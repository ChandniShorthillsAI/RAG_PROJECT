  "query": "what is evolution?",
  "context": ". Evolution shows how certain environments and surroundings will favor the development of specific cognitive functions of the brain to aid an animal or in this case human to successfully live in that environment. Cognitive specialization in a theory in which cognitive functions, such as the ability to communicate socially, can be passed down genetically through offspring. This would benefit species in the process of natural selection\n\n. The main source of knowledge about the evolutionary process has traditionally been the fossil record, but since the development of genetics beginning in the 1970s, DNA analysis has come to occupy a place of comparable importance. The studies of ontogeny, phylogeny and especially evolutionary developmental biology of both vertebrates and invertebrates offer considerable insight into the evolution of all life, including how humans evolved\n\n. More specifically, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness is defined as the set of historically recurring selection pressures that formed a given adaptation, as well as those aspects of the environment that were necessary for the proper development and functioning of the adaptation. Humans, the genus Homo, ap",
  "answer": "Based on the context, evolution refers to the process by which certain environments and surroundings favor the development of specific cognitive functions in the brain to aid an animal or human in successfully living in that environment. It also involves the passing down of these cognitive functions genetically through offspring, benefiting species in the process of natural selection."
