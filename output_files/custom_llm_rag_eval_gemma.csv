What is a characteristic humans developed over their evolutionary history?,"Traits such as bipedalism, dexterity, and complex language","--- # Human evolution Homo sapiens is a distinct species of the hominid family of primates, which also includes all the great apes. Over their evolutionary history, humans gradually developed traits such as bipedalism, dexterity, and complex language, as well as interbreeding with other hominins (a tribe of the African hominid subfamily), indicating that human evolution was not linear but weblike

. sapiens about 70,000 years ago, was controversial from its first proposal in the 1990s and by the 2010s had very little support. Distinctive human genetic variability has arisen as the result of the founder effect, by archaic admixture and by recent evolutionary pressures. Since Homo sapiens separated from its last common ancestor shared with chimpanzees, human evolution is characterized by a number of morphological, developmental, physiological, behavioral, and environmental changes

. This suggests many modern human adaptations represent phylogenetically deep traits and that the behavior and morphology of chimpanzees may have evolved subsequent to the split with the common ancestor they share with humans. The genus Australopithecus evolved in eastern Africa around 4 million years ago ","According to the context, some characteristics that humans developed over their evolutionary history include:

1. Bipedalism
2. Dexterity
3. Complex language

When did primates diverge from other mammals?,About 85 million years ago (mya),". Primates produced successive clades leading to the ape superfamily, which gave rise to the hominid and the gibbon families; these diverged some 15–20 mya. African and Asian hominids (including orangutans) diverged about 14 mya. Hominins (including the Australopithecine and Panina subtribes) parted from the Gorillini tribe between 8 and 9 mya; Australopithecine (including the extinct biped ancestors of humans) separated from the Pan genus (containing chimpanzees and bonobos) 4–7 mya

. Molecular evidence indicates that the lineage of gibbons diverged from the line of great apes some 18–12 mya, and that of orangutans (subfamily Ponginae)[b] diverged from the other great apes at about 12 million years; there are no fossils that clearly document the ancestry of gibbons, which may have originated in a so-far-unknown Southeast Asian hominoid population, but fossil proto-orangutans may be represented by Sivapithecus from India and Griphopithecus from Turkey, dated to around 10 mya

What is mentioned as evidence of a wide diversity of primates during the Early and Middle Miocene?,The presence of other generalized non-cercopithecids from sites far distant,". But it is useless to speculate on this subject, for an ape nearly as large as a man, namely the Dryopithecus of Lartet, which was closely allied to the anthropomorphous Hylobates, existed in Europe during the Upper Miocene period; and since so remote a period the earth has certainly undergone many great revolutions, and there has been ample time for migration on the largest scale.

What percentage of DNA do humans share with chimpanzees?,98.4%,". Human DNA is approximately 98.4% identical to that of chimpanzees when comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms (see human evolutionary genetics). The fossil record, however, of gorillas and chimpanzees is limited; both poor preservation – rain forest soils tend to be acidic and dissolve bone – and sampling bias probably contribute to this problem

. At present estimate, humans have approximately 20,000–25,000 genes and share 99% of their DNA with the now extinct Neanderthal and 95–99% of their DNA with their closest living evolutionary relative, the chimpanzees.

What do authors argue about the evolutionary history of humans?,"That many of the basic human adaptations evolved in the ancient forest and woodland ecosystems of late Miocene and early Pliocene Africa, rather than evolving from a chimpanzee-like ancestor.",". The possibility of linking humans with earlier apes by descent became clear only after 1859 with the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, in which he argued for the idea of the evolution of new species from earlier ones. Darwin's book did not address the question of human evolution, saying only that ""Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."" The first debates about the nature of human evolution arose between Thomas Henry Huxley and Richard Owen

. Huxley argued for human evolution from apes by illustrating many of the similarities and differences between humans and other apes, and did so particularly in his 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Many of Darwin's early supporters (such as Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Lyell) did not initially agree that the origin of the mental capacities and the moral sensibilities of humans could be explained by natural selection, though this later changed

The genera Homo (which includes modern humans), Paranthropus, and Kenyanthropus evolved from some Australopithecus species

. This suggests many modern human adaptations represent phylogenetically deep traits and that the behavior and morphology of chimpanzees may have evolved subsequent to the split with the common ancestor they share with humans. The genus Australopithecus evolved in eastern Africa around 4 million years ago before spreading throughout the continent and eventually becoming extinct 2 million years ago

What is another term for Australopithecus robustus and Australopithecus boisei?,Robust australopiths,". During this time period various forms of australopiths existed, including Australopithecus anamensis, A. afarensis, A. sediba, and A. africanus. There is still some debate among academics whether certain African hominid species of this time, such as A. robustus and A. boisei, constitute members of the same genus; if so, they would be considered to be ""robust australopiths"" while the others would be considered ""gracile australopiths""

. Although similar in some ways to Dart's Australopithecus africanus, Broom's specimen had much larger cheek teeth. Because of this difference, Broom named his specimen Paranthropus robustus, using a new genus name. In doing so, he established the practice of grouping gracile australopiths in the genus Australopithecus and robust australopiths in the genus Paranthropus. During the 1960s, the robust variety was commonly moved into Australopithecus

However, a steady rise in cranial capacity is observed already in Autralopithecina and does not terminate after the emergence of Homo, so that it does not serve as an objective criterion to define the emergence of the genus. Homo habilis emerged about 2.1 Mya. Already before 2010, there were suggestions that H. habilis should not be placed in the genus Homo but rather in Australopithecus

. After a period of stasis with Australopithecus anamensis and Ardipithecus, species which had smaller brains as a result of their bipedal locomotion, the pattern of encephalization started with Homo habilis, whose 600 cm3 (37 cu in) brain was slightly larger than that of chimpanzees.

What percentage of the human genome is thought to have originated from Neanderthals and other hominins?,6%,". Recent DNA evidence suggests that several haplotypes of Neanderthal origin are present among all non-African populations, and Neanderthals and other hominins, such as Denisovans, may have contributed up to 6% of their genome to present-day humans, suggestive of a limited interbreeding between these species

. Today, approximately 2% of DNA from all non-African populations (including Europeans, Asians, and Oceanians) is Neanderthal, with traces of Denisovan heritage. Also, 4–6% of modern Melanesian genetics are Denisovan. Comparisons of the human genome to the genomes of Neandertals, Denisovans and apes can help identify features that set modern humans apart from other hominin species

. The earliest analyses were of Neanderthal DNA, and indicated that the Neanderthal contribution to modern human genetic diversity was no more than 20%, with a most likely value of 0%. By 2010, however, detailed DNA sequencing of the Neanderthal specimens from Europe indicated that the contribution was nonzero, with Neanderthals sharing 1-4% more genetic variants with living non-Africans than with living humans in sub-Saharan Africa

Is there consensus among scientists on which extinct Homo species are direct ancestors of Homo sapiens?,No,". While some (extinct) Homo species might have been ancestors of Homo sapiens, many, perhaps most, were likely ""cousins"", having speciated away from the ancestral hominin line. There is yet no consensus as to which of these groups should be considered a separate species and which should be subspecies; this may be due to the dearth of fossils or to the slight differences used to classify species in the genus Homo

What is one explanation for intermittent migration and speciation in the genus Homo?,The Sahara pump theory,". The Sahara pump theory (describing an occasionally passable ""wet"" Sahara desert) provides one possible explanation of the intermittent migration and speciation in the genus Homo.

What is the name given to this early human species by its discoverer Louis Leakey?,Homo habilis,". One of the first known hominins, it made tools from stone and perhaps animal bones, leading to its name homo habilis (Latin 'handy man') bestowed by discoverer Louis Leakey. Some scientists have proposed moving this species from Homo into Australopithecus due to the morphology of its skeleton being more adapted to living in trees rather than walking on two legs like later hominins. In May 2010, a new species, Homo gautengensis, was discovered in South Africa

. In 1960, the Leakeys discovered the fossil OH 7, also at Olduvai Gorge, and assigned it to a new species, Homo habilis. In 1972, Bernard Ngeneo, a fieldworker working for Richard Leakey, discovered the fossil KNM-ER 1470 near Lake Turkana in Kenya. KNM-ER 1470 has been interpreted as either a distinct species, Homo rudolfensis, or alternatively as evidence of sexual dimorphism in Homo habilis

. In 1950, evolutionary biologist Ernst Walter Mayr said that all bipedal apes should be classified into the genus Homo, and considered renaming Australopithecus to Homo transvaalensis. However, the contrary view taken by J.T. Robinson in 1954, excluding australopiths from Homo, became the prevalent view.

Weidenreich concluded in 1940 that because of their anatomical similarity with modern humans it was necessary to gather all these specimens of Java and China in a single species of the genus Homo, the species H. erectus

. Franz Weidenreich came to Beijing soon after Black’s untimely death in 1934, and took charge of the study of the hominin specimens. Following the loss of the Peking Man materials in late 1941, scientific endeavors at Zhoukoudian slowed, primarily because of lack of funding. Frantic search for the missing fossils took place, and continued well into the 1950s. After the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, excavations resumed at Zhoukoudian

. Separate archaic (non-sapiens) human species including Neanderthals are thought to have survived until around 40,000 years ago.

What was the approximate time range during which Homo erectus lived?,"From about 1.8 Ma to about 70,000 years ago",". erectus. Homo erectus lived from about 1.8 Ma to about 70,000 years ago – which would indicate that they were probably wiped out by the Toba catastrophe; however, nearby H. floresiensis survived it. The early phase of H. erectus, from 1.8 to 1.25 Ma, is considered by some to be a separate species, H. ergaster, or as H. erectus ergaster, a subspecies of H. erectus. Many paleoanthropologists now use the term Homo ergaster for the non-Asian forms of this group, and reserve H

Homo neanderthalensis, alternatively designated as Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, lived in Europe and Asia from 400,000 to about 28,000 years ago

.7–11 million years ago during the Late Miocene. H. erectus appeared about 2 million years ago and spread throughout Africa (debatably as another species called Homo ergaster) and Eurasia in several migrations. The species was adaptive and successful, and persisted for more than a million years before gradually diverging into new species around 500,000 years ago.[b] ","According to the context, Homo erectus lived from about 1.8 Ma (million years ago) to about 70,000 years ago.",0.7,0.8,0.8,0.6,0.0,"The LLM's answer is somewhat correct, but it is not as comprehensive as the ground truth answer. The LLM's answer only covers a portion of the time range specified by the ground truth answer."
What is one of the characteristics that distinguish Homo erectus from H. ergaster?,the skeletal and dental requirements,". Homo habilis, although significantly different of anatomy and physiology, is thought to be the ancestor of Homo ergaster, or African Homo erectus; but it is also known to have coexisted with H. erectus for almost half a million years (until about 1.5 Ma). From its earliest appearance at about 1.9 Ma, H. erectus is distributed in East Africa and Southwest Asia (Homo georgicus). H. erectus is the first known species to develop control of fire, by about 1.5 Ma. H

In Africa in the Early Pleistocene, 1.5–1 Ma, some populations of Homo habilis are thought to have evolved larger brains and to have made more elaborate stone tools; these differences and others are sufficient for anthropologists to classify them as a new species, Homo erectus—in Africa. This species also may have used fire to cook meat

With the publication of Dmanisi skull 5 in 2013, it has become less certain that Asian H. erectus is a descendant of African H. ergaster which was in turn derived from H. habilis. Instead, H. ergaster","According to the context, one of the characteristics that distinguishes Homo erectus from H. ergaster is the skeletal and dental requirements that differ slightly for Asian fossils (H. erectus) compared to African fossils (H. ergaster).",0.9,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.8,"The LLM correctly identifies the skeletal and dental requirements as one of the characteristics that distinguishes Homo erectus from H. ergaster, but it could have provided more specific examples or mentioned the evolutionary timeline of these species."
What is Richard Wrangham's hypothesis for what adaptation separated Homo from tree-sleeping Australopithecines?,Control of fire and cooking,". Richard Wrangham notes that Homo seems to have been ground dwelling, with reduced intestinal length, smaller dentition, and ""brains [swollen] to their current, horrendously fuel-inefficient size"", and hypothesizes that control of fire and cooking, which released increased nutritional value, was the key adaptation that separated Homo from tree-sleeping Australopithecines. These are proposed as species intermediate between H. erectus and H. heidelbergensis. H

. The theory developed before major discoveries of ancient hominin fossils in East Africa. The hypothesis was initially proposed by the English marine biologist Alister Hardy in 1960, who argued that a branch of apes was forced by competition over terrestrial habitats to hunt for food such as shellfish on the coast and seabed, leading to adaptations that explained distinctive characteristics of modern humans such as functional hairlessness and bipedalism

. However, such divergence in chewing adaptations may instead have been a response to fallback food availability. In leaner times, robust and gracile australopithecines may have turned to different low-quality foods (fibrous plants for the former, and hard food for the latte","According to the context, Richard Wrangham hypothesizes that control of fire and cooking was the key adaptation that separated Homo from tree-sleeping Australopithecines.",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.5,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the key factor as control of fire and cooking, which aligns with Richard Wrangham's hypothesis."

What is one anatomical difference between anatomically modern humans and Neanderthal specimens?,Neanderthals had a lower surface-to-volume ratio than modern humans,". There are a number of clear anatomical differences between anatomically modern humans (AMH) and Neanderthal specimens, many relating to the superior Neanderthal adaptation to cold environments. Neanderthal surface to volume ratio was even lower than that among modern Inuit populations, indicating superior retention of body heat. Neanderthals also had significantly larger brains, as shown from brain endocasts, casting doubt on their intellectual inferiority to modern humans

. Some researchers, applying auditory bioengineering models to computerised tomography scans of Neanderthal skulls, have asserted that Neanderthals had auditory capacity very similar to that of anatomically modern humans. These researchers claim that this finding implies that ""Neanderthals evolved the auditory capacities to support a vocal communication system as efficient as modern human speech."" Anatomically modern humans begin to appear in the fossil record in Ethiopia some 200,000 years ago

What is suggested to be one advantage Neanderthals had over modern humans in terms of visual acuity?,better visual acuity,". However, the higher body mass of Neanderthals may have required larger brain mass for body control. Also, recent research by Pearce, Stringer, and Dunbar has shown important differences in brain architecture. The larger size of the Neanderthal orbital chamber and occipital lobe suggests that they had a better visual acuity than modern humans, useful in the dimmer light of glacial Europe. Neanderthals may have had less brain capacity available for social functions

What is the estimated size of Neanderthal social groups?,120 individuals,". Inferring social group size from endocranial volume (minus occipital lobe size) suggests that Neanderthal groups may have been limited to 120 individuals, compared to 144 possible relationships for modern humans. Larger social groups could imply that modern humans had less risk of inbreeding within their clan, trade over larger areas (confirmed in the distribution of stone tools), and faster spread of social and technological innovations

. Based on the size of extant hunter gatherer societies, recent paleolithic hominids lived in bands of a few hundred individuals. As community size increased over the course of human evolution, greater enforcement to achieve group cohesion would have been required. Morality may have evolved in these bands of 100 to 200 people as a means of social control, conflict resolution and group solidarity

. The rate of Neanderthal admixture to European and Asian populations as of 2017 has been estimated at between about 2–3%. Archaic admixture in some Sub-Saharan African populations hunter-gatherer groups (Biaka Pygmies and San), derived from archaic hominins that broke away from the modern human lineage around 700,000 years ago, was discovered in 2011.

What is the estimated year when modern Homo sapiens replaced Neanderthal populations?,"28,000 BP",". All these may have all contributed to modern Homo sapiens replacing Neanderthal populations by 28,000 BP. Earlier evidence from sequencing mitochondrial DNA suggested that no significant gene flow occurred between H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens, and that the two were separate species that shared a common ancestor about 660,000 years ago. However, a sequencing of the Neanderthal genome in 2010 indicated that Neanderthals did indeed interbreed with anatomically modern humans c

.[e] Fossils of early Homo sapiens were found in Qafzeh and Es-Skhul Caves in Israel and have been dated to 80,000 to 120,000 years ago. These humans seem to have either become extinct or retreated back to Africa 70,000 to 80,000 years ago, possibly replaced by southbound Neanderthals escaping the colder regions of ice-age Europe. Hua Liu et al. analyzed autosomal microsatellite markers dating to about 56,000 years ago

. This migration out of Africa is estimated to have begun about 70–50,000 years BP and modern humans subsequently spread globally, replacing earlier hominins either through competition or hybridization. They inhabited Eurasia and Oceania by 40,000 years BP, and the Americas by at least 14","According to the context, modern Homo sapiens replaced Neanderthal populations by 28,000 BP.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.8,0.0,"The LLM correctly states that modern Homo sapiens replaced Neanderthal populations by 28,000 BP, but it does not provide any context or justification for this claim."
"What percentage of the genome of a 40,000-year-old human skeleton from Romania was found to be Neanderthal?",11%,". 45,000-80,000 years ago, around the time modern humans migrated out from Africa, but before they dispersed throughout Europe, Asia and elsewhere. The genetic sequencing of a 40,000-year-old human skeleton from Romania showed that 11% of its genome was Neanderthal, implying the individual had a Neanderthal ancestor 4–6 generations previously, in addition to a contribution from earlier interbreeding in the Middle East

. Though this interbred Romanian population seems not to have been ancestral to modern humans, the finding indicates that interbreeding happened repeatedly. All modern non-African humans have about 1% to 4% (or 1.5% to 2.6% by more recent data) of their DNA derived from Neanderthals. This finding is consistent with recent studies indicating that the divergence of some human alleles dates to one Ma, although this interpretation has been questioned

. Following the genome sequencing of three Vindija Neanderthals, a draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome was published and revealed that Neanderthals shared more alleles with Eurasian populations—such as French, Han Chinese, and Papua New Guinean—than with sub-Saharan African populations, such as Yoruba and San

How long could Neanderthals and AMH Homo sapiens have co-existed in Europe?,"10,000 years",". Neanderthals and AMH Homo sapiens could have co-existed in Europe for as long as 10,000 years, during which AMH populations exploded, vastly outnumbering Neanderthals, possibly outcompeting them by sheer numbers. In 2008, archaeologists working at the site of Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of Siberia uncovered a small bone fragment from the fifth finger of a juvenile member of another human species, the Denisovans

What is the approximate age that the artifacts found in the cave were carbon dated to?,"40,000 BP",". Artifacts, including a bracelet, excavated in the cave at the same level were carbon dated to around 40,000 BP. As DNA had survived in the fossil fragment due to the cool climate of the Denisova Cave, both mtDNA and nuclear DNA were sequenced

.[note 8] A fragment of a jawbone with eight teeth found at Misliya Cave has been dated to around 185,000 years ago. Layers dating from between 250,000 and 140,000 years ago in the same cave contained tools of the Levallois type which could put the date of the first migration even earlier if the tools can be associated with the modern human jawbone finds. These early migrations do not appear to have led to lasting colonisation and receded by about 80,000 years ago

. Early Eurasian Homo sapiens fossils have been found in Apidima Cave (Greece) and Misliya Cave (Israel), dated to 210,000 and 194,000–177,000 years old respectively. These fossils seem to represent failed dispersal attempts by early Homo sapiens, who were likely replaced by local Neanderthal populations

How long did modern humans possibly overlap with Neanderthals in Europe and the Near East?,"more than 40,000 years",". Modern humans are known to have overlapped with Neanderthals in Europe and the Near East for possibly more than 40,000 years, and the discovery raises the possibility that Neanderthals, Denisovans, and modern humans may have co-existed and interbred. The existence of this distant branch creates a much more complex picture of humankind during the Late Pleistocene than previously thought

. Neanderthals were present both in the Middle East and in Europe, and the arriving populations of anatomically modern humans (also known as ""Cro-Magnon"" or European early modern humans) interbred with Neanderthal populations to a limited degree. Populations of modern humans and Neanderthal overlapped in various regions such as the Iberian peninsula and the Middle East. Interbreeding may have contributed Neanderthal genes to palaeolithic and ultimately modern Eurasians and Oceanians

This suggests that the LLM may have made some mistakes in its analysis.
Is there an association between the presence of Neanderthal DNA segments and a higher rate of depression?,Yes,". Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes from Denisovans and Neanderthal represent more than half the HLA alleles of modern Eurasians, indicating strong positive selection for these introgressed alleles. Corinne Simoneti at Vanderbilt University, in Nashville and her team have found from medical records of 28,000 people of European descent that the presence of Neanderthal DNA segments may be associated with a higher rate of depression

. Recent DNA evidence suggests that several haplotypes of Neanderthal origin are present among all non-African populations, and Neanderthals and other hominins, such as Denisovans, may have contributed up to 6% of their genome to present-day humans, suggestive of a limited interbreeding between these species

H. floresiensis is intriguing both for its size and its age, being an example of a recent species of the genus Homo that exhibits derived traits not shared with modern humans. In other words, H. floresiensis shares a common ancestor with modern humans, but split from the modern human lineage and followed a distinct evolutionary path. The main find was a skeleton believed to be a woman of about 30 years of age. Found in 2003, it has been dated to approximately 18,000 years old

Although this is more than the average endocranial volume of chimpanzee brains at 360 cc (22 cu in) the earliest australopiths (A. anamensis) appear to have been within the chimpanzee range, whereas some later australopith specimens have a larger endocranial volume than that of some early Homo fossils

. After a period of stasis with Australopithecus anamensis and Ardipithecus, species which had smaller brains as a result of their bipedal locomotion, the pattern of encephalization started with Homo habilis, whose 600 cm3 (37 cu in) brain was slightly larger than that of chimpanzees. This evolution continued in Homo erectus with 800–1,100 cm3 (49–67 cu in), and reached a maximum in Neanderthals with 1,200–1,900 cm3 (73–116 cu in), larger even than modern Homo sapiens

When did scientists suggest that modern humans arose?,"between 260,000 and 350,000 years ago",". The modern field of paleoanthropology began in the 19th century with the discovery of ""Neanderthal man"" (the eponymous skeleton was found in 1856, but there had been finds elsewhere since 1830), and with evidence of so-called cave men.

Between 400,000 years ago and the second interglacial period in the Middle Pleistocene, around 250,000 years ago, the trend in intra-cranial volume expansion and the elaboration of stone tool technologies developed, providing evidence for a transition from H. erectus to H. sapiens. The direct evidence suggests there was a migration of H. erectus out of Africa, then a further speciation of H. sapiens from H. erectus in Africa

What is one of the significant human adaptations discovered during the Pleistocene era?,Bipedalism,". Environmental (cultural) evolution discovered much later during the Pleistocene played a significant role in human evolution observed via human transitions between subsistence systems. The most significant of these adaptations are bipedalism, increased brain size, lengthened ontogeny (gestation and infancy), and decreased sexual dimorphism. The relationship between these changes is the subject of ongoing debate

.6 million years ago. Because the Pleistocene ended a mere 12,000 years ago, most human adaptations either newly evolved during the Pleistocene, or were maintained by stabilizing selection during the Pleistocene. Evolutionary psychology, therefore, proposes that the majority of human psychological mechanisms are adapted to reproductive problems frequently encountered in Pleistocene environments

. This suggests many modern human adaptations represent phylogenetically deep traits and that the behavior and morphology of chimpanzees may have evolved subsequent to the split with the common ancestor they share with humans. The genus Australopithecus evolved in eastern Africa around 4 million years ago before spreading throughout the continent and eventually becoming extinct 2 ",One of the significant human adaptations discovered during the Pleistocene era is bipedalism.,1.0,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.0,"The answer is partially correct, but it does not provide specific details about the significant human adaptations discovered during the Pleistocene era."

"When did Ardipithecus, a full biped, arise?",Approximately 5.6 million years ago,".

What was one advantage of bipedalism that helped humans thrive in their new environment?,saved energy during locomotion,". Nonetheless, it remains a matter of controversy as to how bipedalism first emerged. The advantages of bipedalism were that it left the hands free to grasp objects (e.g., carry food and young), and allowed the eyes to look over tall grasses for possible food sources or predators, but it is also argued that these advantages were not significant enough to cause the emergence of bipedalism

. Only after the more demanding posture was enabled by changes in the nervous system, could advantages of bipedal over quadrupedal locomotion be utilized, including better scanning of the environment, carrying food and infants, simultaneous upper extremity movements and observation of the environment, limitless manipulation of objects with upper extremities, and less space for rotating around the Z-axis

. It is possible that bipedalism was favored because it freed the hands for reaching and carrying food, saved energy during locomotion, enabled long-distance running and hunting, provided an enhanced field of vision, and helped avoid hyperthermia by reducing the surface area exposed to direct sun; features all advantageous for thriving in the new savanna and woodland environment created as a resul","According to the context, one advantage of bipedalism that helped humans thrive in their new environment was that it helped avoid hyperthermia by reducing the surface area exposed to direct sun.",0.8,0.9,0.7,0.8,0.0,"The context mainly focuses on the advantages of bipedalism, such as the ability to grasp objects and look over tall grasses.

What is one of the ways in which the human spine changed as a result of evolving to an upright position?,It became S-shaped,". The femur evolved into a slightly more angular position to move the center of gravity toward the geometric center of the body. The knee and ankle joints became increasingly robust to better support increased weight. To support the increased weight on each vertebra in the upright position, the human vertebral column became S-shaped and the lumbar vertebrae became shorter and wider. In the feet the big toe moved into alignment with the other toes to help in forward locomotion

. If the inward curvature of the spine is not enough, the center of balance would be offset causing the body to essentially tip forward, which is why some apes that have the ability to be bipedal require large amounts of energy to stand up. In addition to sacral angles, the sacrum has also evolved to be more flexible in comparison to the stiff sacrum that apes possess. The human skull is balanced on the vertebral column

. The sacrum has also become more broad, increasing the diameter of the birth canal and making birthing easier.

What is one significant change that occurred in the pelvic region of bipedal hominids?,The long downward-facing iliac blade was shortened and widened,". The arms and forearms shortened relative to the legs making it easier to run. The foramen magnum migrated under the skull and more anterior. The most significant changes occurred in the pelvic region, where the long downward facing iliac blade was shortened and widened as a requirement for keeping the center of gravity stable while walking; bipedal hominids have a shorter but broader, bowl-like pelvis due to this

. Another change is the shape of the big toe. Recent studies suggest that australopithecines still lived part of the time in trees as a result of maintaining a grasping big toe. This was progressively lost in habilines. Anatomically, the evolution of bipedalism has been accompanied by a large number of skeletal changes, not just to the legs and pelvis, but also to the vertebral column, feet and ankles, and skull

What is the limitation on the widening of the birth canal in bipedal apes?,Further increase can hinder normal bipedal movement,". A drawback is that the birth canal of bipedal apes is smaller than in knuckle-walking apes, though there has been a widening of it in comparison to that of australopithecine and modern humans, thus permitting the passage of newborns due to the increase in cranial size. This is limited to the upper portion, since further increase can hinder normal bipedal movement

. The shortening of the pelvis and smaller birth canal evolved as a requirement for bipedalism and had significant effects on the process of human birth, which is much more difficult in modern humans than in other primates. During human birth, because of the variation in size of the pelvic region, the fetal head must be in a transverse position (compared to the mother) during entry into the birth canal and rotate about 90 degrees upon exit

. The smaller birth canal became a limiting factor to brain size increases in early humans and prompted a shorter gestation period leading to the relative immaturity of human offspring, who are unable to walk much before 12 months and have greater neoteny, compared to other primates, who are mobile at a much earlier age

. It is speculated that alleles influencing sexual behavior wou","According to the context, the limitation on the widening of the birth canal in bipedal apes is that further increase can hinder normal bipedal movement.

During human birth, because of the variation in size of the pelvic region, the fetal head must be in a transverse position (compared to the mother) during entry into the birth canal and rotate about 90 degrees upon exit

. Prehistoric fossil records show that early hominins first developed bipedalism before being followed by an increase in brain size. The consequences of these two changes in particular resulted in painful and difficult labor due to the increased favor of a narrow pelvis for bipedalism being countered by larger heads passing through the constricted birth canal. This phenomenon is commonly known as the obstetrical dilemma

. Non-human primates habitually deliver their young on their own, but the same cannot be said for modern-day humans. Isolated birth appears to be rare and actively avoided cross-culturally, even if birthing methods may differ between said cultures. This is due to the fact that the narrowing of the hips and the change in the pelv","According to the context, the required position of the fetal head during entry into the human birth canal is a transverse position (compared to the mother).",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.6,1.0,The LLM correctly states that the fetal head must be in a transverse position during entry into the human birth canal.
What is the approximate age by which human offspring can start walking?,12 months,". The smaller birth canal became a limiting factor to brain size increases in early humans and prompted a shorter gestation period leading to the relative immaturity of human offspring, who are unable to walk much before 12 months and have greater neoteny, compared to other primates, who are mobile at a much earlier age

. It also exists as a lesser response in other animals, including human babies up to 6 months old (see infant swimming). However adult humans generally exhibit a mild response. Hardy additionally posited that bipedalism evolved first as an aid to wading before becoming the usual means of human locomotion, and tool use evolved out of the use of rocks to crack open shellfish. These last arguments were cited by later proponents of AAH as an inspiration for their research programs

. Earlier fossils, such as Orrorin tugenensis, indicate bipedalism around six million years ago, around the time of the split between humans and chimpanzees indicated by genetic studies. This suggests that erect, straight-legged walking originated as an adaptation to tree-dwelling. Major changes to the pelvis and feet had already taken place before Australopithecus. It was once thought that ","According to the context, human offspring are unable to walk much before 12 months. Therefore, the approximate age by which human offspring can start walking is around 12 months.",0.7,0.8,0.85,0.75,0.0,"The LLM correctly states that human offspring cannot walk much before 12 months, which aligns with the ground truth. The context also provides some supporting information about the limitations on brain size increases in early humans."
What is one way in which the human reproductive cycle was affected?,The increased brain growth after birth and the increased dependency of children on mothers had a major effect upon the female reproductive cycle.,". The increased brain growth after birth and the increased dependency of children on mothers had a major effect upon the female reproductive cycle, and the more frequent appearance of alloparenting in humans when compared with other hominids

. Furthermore, same-sex harassment in some nonhuman animals impacted females' ovulation capabilities, which suggests that human females' reproductive success could be influenced by the stress induced by indirect or direct peer victimization

. In contemporary times, since industrialization, some trends have been observed: for instance, menopause is evolving to occur later. Other reported trends appear to include lengthening of the human reproductive period and reduction in cholesterol levels, blood glucose and blood pressure in some populations. The name Homo of the biological genus to which humans belong is Latin for 'human'.[e] It was chosen originally by Carl Linnaeus in his classification system

What is the approximate volume of a human brain compared to that of a chimpanzee or gorilla?,nearly three times,". The brains of most species of Australopithecus were roughly 35% of the size of a modern human brain with an endocranial volume average of 466 cc (28.4 cu in). Although this is more than the average endocranial volume of chimpanzee brains at 360 cc (22 cu in) the earliest australopiths (A. anamensis) appear to have been within the chimpanzee range, whereas some later australopith specimens have a larger endocranial volume than that of some early Homo fossils

. The living woman was estimated to be one meter in height, with a brain volume of just 380 cm3 (considered small for a chimpanzee and less than a third of the H. sapiens average of 1400 cm3). However, there is an ongoing debate over whether H. floresiensis is indeed a separate species. Some scientists hold that H. floresiensis was a modern H. sapiens with pathological dwarfism

. After a period of stasis with Australopithecus anamensis and Ardipithecus, species which had smaller brains as a result of their bipedal locomotion, the pattern of encephalization started with Homo habilis, whose 600 cm3 (37 cu in) brain was slightly larger than that of chimpanzees. This evolution continued in Homo erectus with 800–1,100 cm3 (49–67 ","Based on the context, we can't determine the exact volume difference between a human brain and a chimpanzee/gorilla brain.

After a period of stasis with Australopithecus anamensis and Ardipithecus, species which had smaller brains as a result of their bipedal locomotion, the pattern of encephalization started with Homo habilis, whose 600 cm3 (37 cu in) brain was slightly larger than that of chimpanzees. This evolution continued in Homo erectus with 800–1,100 cm3 (49–67 cu in), and reached a maximum in Neanderthals with 1,200–1,900 cm3 (73–116 cu in), larger even than modern Homo sapiens

. During human evolution, on at least two occasions, hominid brain size increased rapidly over a short period of time followed by a period of stasis. The first period of brain expansion occurred 2.5 million years ago, when Homo habilis first began using stone tools. The second period occurred 500,000 years ago, with the emergence of archaic Homo sapiens

. Some scientists consider Homo rudolfensis, a larger bodied group of fossils with similar morphology to the original H. habilis fossils, to be a separate species, while others consider them to be part of H. habilis—simply representing intraspecies variation, or perhaps even sexual dimorphism.

What was the primary factor that led to the increase in brain size in humans?,"A dependency on calorie-dense, difficult-to-acquire food.",". Increasing brain size has also been significant in human evolution. It began to increase approximately 2.4 million years ago, but modern levels of brain size were not attained until after 500,000 years ago. Zoological analyses have shown that the size of human brains is significantly larger than what anatomists would expect for their size. The human brain is three to four times larger than its closest relative, which is the chimpanzee

When did early humans develop their present-day brain shape?,"Between 100,000 and 35,000 years ago",". Fossilized skulls shows the brain size in early humans fell within the range of modern humans 300,000 years ago, but only got its present-day brain shape between 100,000 and 35,000 years ago. The temporal lobes, which contain centers for language processing, have increased disproportionately, as has the prefrontal cortex, which has been related to complex decision-making and moderating social behavior

. In September 2019, scientists reported the computerized determination, based on 260 CT scans, of a virtual skull shape of the last common human ancestor to anatomically modern humans, representative of the earliest modern humans, and suggested that modern humans arose between 260,000 and 350,000 years ago through a merging of populations in East and South Africa.

What factor has been proposed to have contributed to the increase in intelligence?,the increased necessity for solving social problems as human society became more complex,". Encephalization has been tied to increased starches and meat in the diet, however a 2022 meta study called into question the role of meat. Other factors are the development of cooking, and it has been proposed that intelligence increased as a response to an increased necessity for solving social problems as human society became more complex. Changes in skull morphology, such as smaller mandibles and mandible muscle attachments, allowed more room for the brain to grow

. Current consensus about the evolutionary development of the human brain accepts sexual selection as a potential contributing factor but maintains that human intelligence and the ability to store and share cultural knowledge would have likely carried high survival value as well

. The increasing brain size allowed advanced provisioning and tools and the technological advances during the Palaeolithic era that built upon the previous evolutionary innovations of bipedalism and hand versatility allowed the development of human language

What is one function of the cerebellum?,Balance,". The increase in volume of the neocortex also included a rapid increase in size of the cerebellum. Its function has traditionally been associated with balance and fine motor control, but more recently with speech and cognition. The great apes, including hominids, had a more pronounced cerebellum relative to the neocortex than other primates

. It has been suggested that because of its function of sensory-motor control and learning complex muscular actions, the cerebellum may have underpinned human technological adaptations, including the preconditions of speech. The immediate survival advantage of encephalization is difficult to discern, as the major brain changes from Homo erectus to Homo heidelbergensis were not accompanied by major changes in technology

. The brain allows an individual to recognize patterns, perceive speech, develop strategies to circumvent ecologically-based problems such as foraging for food, and also permits the phenomenon of color vision. It is said that in humans and primates the neocortex is responsible for reasoning and consciousness. Furthermore, having a large brain is a reflection of the large cognitive demands of complex social systems

What is one way humans are unique compared to other animals?,The ability to acquire information through social transmission,". Highly social mammals such as primates and elephants have been known to exhibit traits that were once thought to be uniquely human, like empathy and altruism. Humanity's closest living relatives are common chimpanzees and bonobos. These primates share a common ancestor with humans who lived four to six million years ago. It is for this reason that chimpanzees and bonobos are viewed as the best available surrogate for this common ancestor

. Notably, humans evolved in a quite different environment than that of these animals. Human survival became easier with the development of tools, shelter, and fire, thus facilitating further advancement of social interaction, self-expression, and tool-making, as for hunting and gathering

. Comparing a given gene with that of other species enables geneticists to determine whether it is rapidly evolving in humans alone. For example, while human DNA is on average 98% identical to chimp DNA, the so-called Human Accelerated Region 1 (HAR1), involved in the development of the brain, is only 85% similar

... is not the claim that such features do not appear elsewhere; the genetic structure of the human species makes such a possibility unlikely to the","One way humans are unique compared to other animals is in their genetic structure, specifically with respect to the Human Accelerated Region 1 (HAR1), which is involved in brain development and is only 85% similar to that of chimpanzees, compared to an average similarity of 98%.",1.0,0.85,0.8,0.5,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the genetic structure of the Human Accelerated Region 1 (HAR1) as a key factor contributing to human uniqueness, but the relevance score is lower than expected due to the limited context."
What is a primary visible difference between human sexual dimorphism and that of other ape species?,The reduced degree of male canine tooth relative to other ape species (except gibbons),". The reduced degree of sexual dimorphism in humans is visible primarily in the reduction of the male canine tooth relative to other ape species (except gibbons) and reduced brow ridges and general robustness of males. Another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of hidden estrus

. Chimpanzees and humans have the greatest sexual dimorphism in fundamental frequency of all hominids. Males are also more likely to engage in physical risks in front of competitors, and males who take more physical risks are perceived as being stronger. Status badges such as facial hair are generally related to men being perceived as more dominant. Facial hair makes the jaw appear more prominent and shows emotions like anger clearly which makes a male appear more threatening

. In contrast, gorillas living in harems exhibit a much stronger sexual dimorphism (see: homininae). The theory of sexual selection has been used to explain a number of human anatomical features. These include rounded breasts, facial hair, pubic hair and penis size. The breasts of primates are flat, yet are able to produce sufficient milk for feeding their young. The breasts of non-lactatin","According to the context, a primary visible difference between human sexual dimorphism and that of other ape species (except gibbons) is the reduction of the male canine tooth relative to other ape species.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.8,"The LLM's answer provides a correct description of a primary visible difference between human sexual dimorphism and that of other ape species (except gibbons). However, the LLM could provide a more detailed description of the difference, such as the reduction of the canine tooth relative to other ape species."
What is the approximate percentage by which human males are larger than females?,15%,". In all living hominid species, males are more muscular, allowing them to have more strength and power. Human males have 61% more overall muscle mass compared to females. This greater muscle mass allows males to gain greater acceleration, speed, and more powerful striking movements. Compared to females, human males exhibit more same-sex aggression, which peaks in young adulthood

. Most species of Australopithecus were diminutive and gracile, usually standing 1.2 to 1.4 m (3 ft 11 in to 4 ft 7 in) tall. It is possible that they exhibited a considerable degree of sexual dimorphism, males being larger than females. In modern populations, males are on average a mere 15% larger than females, while in Australopithecus, males could be up to 50% larger than females by some estimates

. Greater overall body fat percentage in human females appears to be unique among primates and may function in storing resources needed to gestate and support large-brained offspring as well as in sexual selection. For example, higher female body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased fertility in young women, particularly those in subsistence societies. Lower WHR, lower BMI, and smaller waist sizes a","According to the context, human males have 61% more overall muscle mass compared to females.",0.8,0.7,0.6,0.5,0.9,"The answer provides a factual statement about the relative muscle mass of males and females, but it lacks nuance and does not offer a clear understanding of the context or the implications of this difference."
What is unique to the genus Homo?,The ulnar opposition—the contact between the thumb and the tip of the little finger of the same hand,". deyiremeda. --- # Homo For other species or subspecies suggested, see below. Homo (from Latin homō 'human') is a genus of great ape (family Hominidae) that emerged from the genus Australopithecus and encompasses only a single extant species, Homo sapiens (modern humans), along with a number of extinct species (collectively called archaic humans) classified as either ancestral or closely related to modern humans; these include Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis

. neanderthalensis 1864, H. erectus 1892). The genus Homo has not been strictly defined, even today. Since the early human fossil record began to slowly emerge from the earth, the boundaries and definitions of the genus have been poorly defined and constantly in flux. Because there was no reason to think it would ever have any additional members, Carl Linnaeus did not even bother to define Homo when he first created it for humans in the 18th century

. The term ""hominin"" refers to any genus in the human tribe (Hominini), of which Homo sapiens (modern humans) is the only living specimen. In 1758 Carl Linnaeus introduced the name Homo sapiens as a species name in the 10th edition of his work Systema Naturae although with","According to the context, what is unique to the genus Homo is that it encompasses only a single extant species, Homo sapiens (modern humans), along with a number of extinct species.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.5,0.0,"The LLM's answer is somewhat correct, but it provides only a partial overview of the genus Homo.

What characteristic of the human thumb allows for precision and power grip?,Ulnar opposition,". In other primates, the thumb is short and unable to touch the little finger. The ulnar opposition facilitates the precision grip and power grip of the human hand, underlying all the skilled manipulations

The third metacarpal styloid process enables the hand bone to lock into the wrist bones, allowing for greater amounts of pressure to be applied to the wrist and hand from a grasping thumb and fingers. It allows humans the dexterity and strength to make and use complex tools

What is the ratio of eccrine sweat gland density in humans compared to other catarrhinian primates?,ten times higher,". A number of other changes have also characterized the evolution of humans, among them an increased reliance on vision rather than smell (highly reduced olfactory bulb); a longer juvenile developmental period and higher infant dependency; a smaller gut and small, misaligned teeth; faster basal metabolism; loss of body hair; an increase in eccrine sweat gland density that is ten times higher than any other catarrhinian primates, yet humans use 30% to 50% less water per day compared to chimps and

. Human trichromatic color vision had its genetic origins in this period. Catarrhines lost the vomeronasal organ (or possibly reduced it to vestigial status). Proconsul was an early genus of catarrhine primates. They had a mixture of Old World monkey and ape characteristics. Proconsul's monkey-like features include thin tooth enamel, a light build with a narrow chest and short forelimbs, and an arboreal quadrupedal lifestyle

. Aboriginal Australians undergo a similar process, where the body cools but the metabolic rate does not increase. Humans and their evolutionary predecessors in Central Africa have been living in similar tropical climates for millions of years, which means that they h","According to the context, the answer is:

What is one difference between humans and chimps/gorillas?,Humans use 50% less water per day compared to chimps and gorillas.,". Human DNA is approximately 98.4% identical to that of chimpanzees when comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms (see human evolutionary genetics). The fossil record, however, of gorillas and chimpanzees is limited; both poor preservation – rain forest soils tend to be acidic and dissolve bone – and sampling bias probably contribute to this problem

. According to Richard Dawkins in his book ""The Ancestor's Tale"", chimps and bonobos are descended from Australopithecus gracile type species while gorillas are descended from Paranthropus. These apes may have once been bipedal, but then lost this ability when they were forced back into an arboreal habitat, presumably by those australopithecines from whom eventually evolved hominins

. Chimpanzees are also known to mourn the dead, and notice things that have only aesthetic value, like sunsets, both of which may be considered to be components of religion or spirituality.[unreliable source?] The difference between the comprehension of causality by humans and chimpanzees is one of degree.

What was one side effect of the adaptation of the human hand and arms to making tools?,"The ability to throw objects with greater force, speed and accuracy",". As the human hand and arms adapted to the making of tools and were used less for climbing, the shoulder blades changed too. As a side effect, it allowed human ancestors to throw objects with greater force, speed and accuracy. The use of tools has been interpreted as a sign of intelligence, and it has been theorized that tool use may have stimulated certain aspects of human evolution, especially the continued expansion of the human brain

. Given the probability that this applied also to early humans, it is hard to see why they should have abandoned this efficient method in favour of more costly and cumbersome systems of visual gesturing – only to return to sound at a later stage. By way of explanation, it has been proposed that at a relatively late stage in human evolution, hands became so much in demand for making and using tools that the competing demands of manual gesturing became a hindrance

. This aided in balance when in the trees but lost its prominence when bipedalism was adapted. The arms also became shorter (opposite in comparison to legs) for carrying objects and using them as multi-tasking agents instead of climbing and swinging in trees. It is well known that the Ho","According to the context, one side effect of the adaptation of the human hand and arms to making tools was that it allowed human ancestors to throw objects with greater force, speed, and accuracy.",1.0,0.8,0.7,0.6,0.9,"The LLM correctly states that one side effect of the adaptation of the human hand and arms to making tools was that it allowed human ancestors to throw objects with greater force, speed, and accuracy."
What is the average amount of energy consumed by the brain of a modern human?,260 kilocalories per day,". Paleontology has yet to explain the expansion of this organ over millions of years despite being extremely demanding in terms of energy consumption. The brain of a modern human consumes, on average, about 13 watts (260 kilocalories per day), a fifth of the body's resting power consumption. Increased tool use would allow hunting for energy-rich meat products, and would enable processing more energy-rich plant products

. This is despite access to many non-thermal processing, like grinding, pounding or heating to 48 °C. (118 °F). With approximately 86 billion neurons in the human brain and 60–70 kg body mass, an exclusively raw diet close to that of what extant primates have would be not viable as, when modelled, it is argued that it would require an infeasible level of more than nine hours of feeding every day

. Some hypotheses about the evolution of the human brain argue that it is a sexually selected trait, as it would not confer enough fitness in itself relative to its high maintenance costs (a fifth to a quarter of the energy and oxygen consumed by a human)

What is the approximate time period when early australopithecines are thought to have possibly used broken bones as tools?,4 million years ago (Ma),". Researchers have suggested that early hominins were thus under evolutionary pressure to increase their capacity to create and use tools. Precisely when early humans started to use tools is difficult to determine, because the more primitive these tools are (for example, sharp-edged stones) the more difficult it is to decide whether they are natural objects or human artifacts. There is some evidence that the australopithecines (4 Ma) may have used broken bones as tools, but this is debated

What is the estimated age of the oldest known tools?,3.3 million years ago,". Many species make and use tools, but it is the human genus that dominates the areas of making and using more complex tools. The oldest known tools are flakes from West Turkana, Kenya, which date to 3.3 million years ago. The next oldest stone tools are from Gona, Ethiopia, and are considered the beginning of the Oldowan technology. These tools date to about 2.6 million years ago. A Homo fossil was found near some Oldowan tools, and its age was noted at 2

. Dated to around 3.3 million years ago, the implements are some 700,000 years older than stone tools from Ethiopia that previously held this distinction. The period from 700,000 to 300,000 years ago is also known as the Acheulean, when H. ergaster (or erectus) made large stone hand axes out of flint and quartzite, at first quite rough (Early Acheulian), later ""retouched"" by additional, more-subtle strikes at the sides of the flakes

. Stone tools are first attested around 2.6 million years ago, when hominins in Eastern Africa used so-called core tools, choppers made out of round cores that had been split by simple strikes.

What anatomical feature distinguishes humans from other apes and nonhuman primates?,The ability to speak,". Sarmiento noted that Ardipithecus does not share any characteristics exclusive to humans, and some of its characteristics (those in the wrist and basicranium) suggest it diverged from humans prior to the human–gorilla last common ancestor

. However, Sarmiento (2010), noting that Ardipithecus does not share any characteristics exclusive to humans and some of its characteristics (those in the wrist and basicranium), suggested that it may have diverged from the common human/African ape stock prior to the human, chimpanzee and gorilla divergence. Another candidate that has been suggested is Graecopithecus, though this claim is disputed as there is insufficient evidence to support the determination of Graecopithecus as hominin

Who argued that both Homo and Paranthropus species were toolmakers based on the anatomy of opposable thumbs?,Randall Susman,". Most paleoanthropologists agree that the early Homo species were indeed responsible for most of the Oldowan tools found. They argue that when most of the Oldowan tools were found in association with human fossils, Homo was always present, but Paranthropus was not. In 1994, Randall Susman used the anatomy of opposable thumbs as the basis for his argument that both the Homo and Paranthropus species were toolmakers

. This unique anatomical feature separates humans from other apes and other nonhuman primates, and is not seen in human fossils older than 1.8 million years. Bernard Wood noted that Paranthropus co-existed with the early Homo species in the area of the ""Oldowan Industrial Complex"" over roughly the same span of time. Although there is no direct evidence which identifies Paranthropus as the tool makers, their anatomy lends to indirect evidence of their capabilities in this area

What are some examples of cultural and behavioral traits described by anthropologists for modern human behavior?,"specialization of tools, use of jewellery and images (such as cave drawings), organization of living space, rituals (such as grave gifts), specialized hunting techniques, exploration of less hospitable geographical areas, and barter trade networks",". Anthropologists describe modern human behavior to include cultural and behavioral traits such as specialization of tools, use of jewellery and images (such as cave drawings), organization of living space, rituals (such as grave gifts), specialized hunting techniques, exploration of less hospitable geographical areas, and barter trade networks, as well as more general traits such as language and complex symbolic thinking

. Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations, including the abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, and cooperate with others. Findings have been made regarding human social behaviour related to infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price, and parental investment

. Two major topics of study in both sociology and cultural anthropology are human cultures and cultural variation. However, Dual Inheritance theorists charge that both disciplines too often treat culture as a static superorganic entity that dictates human behavior.

What was the approximate time period during which stone tools progressed stepwise?,"50,000-40,000 years ago",". Stone tools are first attested around 2.6 million years ago, when hominins in Eastern Africa used so-called core tools, choppers made out of round cores that had been split by simple strikes. This marks the beginning of the Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age; its end is taken to be the end of the last Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago

. Debate continues as to whether a ""revolution"" led to modern humans (""big bang of human consciousness""), or whether the evolution was more gradual. Until about 50,000–40,000 years ago, the use of stone tools seems to have progressed stepwise. Each phase (H. habilis, H. ergaster, H. neanderthalensis) marked a new technology, followed by very slow development until the next phase. Currently paleoanthropologists are debating whether these Homo species possessed some or many modern human behaviors

. The Paleolithic is subdivided into the Lower Paleolithic (Early Stone Age), ending around 350,000–300,000 years ago, the Middle Paleolithic (Middle Stone Age), until 50,000–30,000 years ago, and the Upper Paleolithic, (Late Stone Age), 50,000–10,000 years ago. Archaeologists working in the Great Rift Valley in Kenya have discovered the oldest known stone tools ","According to the context, the approximate time period during which stone tools progressed stepwise is until about 50,000-40,000 years ago.",0.75,0.85,0.9,0.9,0.0,"The LLM provides a reasonable timeframe, but it could be more specific about the exact range of progression."
What was the time period when human culture started to evolve more rapidly?,"Around 50,000 BP",". They seem to have been culturally conservative, maintaining the same technologies and foraging patterns over very long periods. Around 50,000 BP, human culture started to evolve more rapidly. The transition to behavioral modernity has been characterized by some as a ""Great Leap Forward"", or as the ""Upper Palaeolithic Revolution"", due to the sudden appearance in the archaeological record of distinctive signs of modern behavior and big game hunting

. It has been argued that human evolution has accelerated since the development of agriculture 10,000 years ago and civilization some 5,000 years ago, resulting, it is claimed, in substantial genetic differences between different current human populations, and more recent research indicates that for some traits, the developments and innovations of human culture have driven a new form of selection that coexists with, and in some cases has largely replaced, natural selection

. Debate continues as to whether a ""revolution"" led to modern humans (""big bang of human consciousness""), or whether the evolution was more gradual.

When did the transition to modernity occur?,Sooner than previously believed,". According to some anthropologists, the transition to behavioral modernity with the development of symbolic culture, language, and specialized lithic technology happened around 50,000 years ago (beginning of the Upper Paleolithic), although others point to evidence of a gradual change over a longer time span during the Middle Paleolithic.

When did the Australian Aboriginal population separate from the African population?,"75,000 years ago",". Other scholars consider the transition to have been more gradual, noting that some features had already appeared among archaic African Homo sapiens 300,000–200,000 years ago. Recent evidence suggests that the Australian Aboriginal population separated from the African population 75,000 years ago, and that they made a 160 km (99 mi) sea journey 60,000 years ago, which may diminish the significance of the Upper Paleolithic Revolution

. For reference, Homo sapiens and Neanderthals diverged ~500 kya. It is thought that Australia was inhabited around 65,000–50,000 years ago. As of 2017, the earliest evidence of humans in Australia is at least 65,000 years old, while McChesney stated that ...genetic evidence suggests that a small band with the marker M168 migrated out of Africa along the coasts of the Arabian Peninsula and India, through Indonesia, and reached Australia very early, between 60,000 and 50,000 years ago

. This supports the theory of a single migration into Australia and New Guinea before the arrival of Modern Asians (between 25,000 and 38,000 years ago) and their later migration into North America.

"What is one technology that humans developed around 50,000 years ago?",hunting with more sophisticated techniques (such as using pit traps or driving animals off cliffs),". Modern humans started burying their dead, making clothing from animal hides, hunting with more sophisticated techniques (such as using pit traps or driving animals off cliffs), and cave painting. As human culture advanced, different populations innovated existing technologies: artifacts such as fish hooks, buttons, and bone needles show signs of cultural variation, which had not been seen prior to 50,000 BP.

Currently paleoanthropologists are debating whether these Homo species possessed some or many modern human behaviors

Moreover, a combination of gene flow from Eurasia back into Africa and higher rates of genetic drift among East Asians compared to Europeans led these human populations to diverge ","According to the context, one technology that humans developed around 50,000 years ago was more sophisticated hunting techniques, including using pit traps or driving animals off cliffs.",0.8,0.9,0.7,0.6,0.0,"The LLM's answer is factually correct, but it does not accurately capture the historical context or nuance of human innovation in this era."
What is a characteristic of the older H. neanderthalensis populations?,They did not vary in their technologies,". Typically, the older H. neanderthalensis populations did not vary in their technologies, although the Chatelperronian assemblages have been found to be Neanderthal imitations of H. sapiens Aurignacian technologies. Anatomically modern human populations continue to evolve, as they are affected by both natural selection and genetic drift

. There are a number of clear anatomical differences between anatomically modern humans (AMH) and Neanderthal specimens, many relating to the superior Neanderthal adaptation to cold environments. Neanderthal surface to volume ratio was even lower than that among modern Inuit populations, indicating superior retention of body heat. Neanderthals also had significantly larger brains, as shown from brain endocasts, casting doubt on their intellectual inferiority to modern humans

. During this time, the Neanderthals were slowly being displaced. Because it took so long for Europe to be occupied, it appears that humans and Neanderthals may have been constantly competing for territory. The Neanderthals had larger brains, and were larger overall, with a more robust or heavily built frame, which suggests that they were physically stronger than modern Homo ","According to the context, a characteristic of the older H. neanderthalensis populations is that ""typically, [they] did not vary in their technologies"".",0.8,0.9,0.7,0.9,0.8,"The LLM correctly identifies the context's statement, but the answer itself is factually incorrect."

How many years ago did civilization develop?,"5,000",".5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as Homo habilis, while others place the development of symbolic communication only with Homo erectus (1.8 million years ago) or with Homo heidelbergensis (0.6 million years ago) and the development of language proper with Homo sapiens, currently estimated at less than 200,000 years ago

Berwick and Chomsky therefore suggest language emerged approximately between 200,000 years ago and 60,000 years ago (between the appearance of the first anatomically modern humans in southern Africa and the last exodus from Africa respectively).

What is an example of a superficial characteristic that has evolved due to differences in climate?,Afro-textured hair,". Particularly conspicuous is variation in superficial characteristics, such as Afro-textured hair, or the recent evolution of light skin and blond hair in some populations, which are attributed to differences in climate. Particularly strong selective pressures have resulted in high-altitude adaptation in humans, with different ones in different isolated populations

. However, variations in manifest behavior can result from universal mechanisms interacting with different local environments. For example, Caucasians who move from a northern climate to the equator will have darker skin. The mechanisms regulating their pigmentation do not change; rather the input to those mechanisms change, resulting in different outputs

.[note 2] People from warmer climates tend to have thicker lips, which have large surface areas, enabling them to keep cool. With regards to nose shapes, humans residing in hot and dry places tend to have narrow and protruding noses in order to reduce loss of moisture. Humans living in hot and humid places tend to have flat and broad noses that moisturize inhaled air and retain moisture from exhaled air

What is the estimated time frame for the evolution of EPAS1 in Tibetans?,"3,000 years",". Studies of the genetic basis show that some developed very recently, with Tibetans evolving over 3,000 years to have high proportions of an allele of EPAS1 that is adaptive to high altitudes. Other evolution is related to endemic diseases: the presence of malaria selects for sickle cell trait (the heterozygous form of sickle cell gene), while in the absence of malaria, the health effects of sickle-cell anemia select against this trait

. Some climatic adaptations, such as high-altitude adaptation in humans, are thought to have been acquired by archaic admixture. An ethnic group known as the Sherpas from Nepal is believed to have inherited an allele called EPAS1, which allows them to breathe easily at high altitudes, from the Denisovans

. A subsequent study from 2021, based on ancient DNA samples, has suggested that the derived variant became dominant among ""Ancient Northern East Asians"" shortly after the Last Glacial Maximum in Northeast Asia, around 19,000 years ago.

What is the genetic variant responsible for the over-representation in the population at risk of kuru?,G127V,". For another example, the population at risk of the severe debilitating disease kuru has significant over-representation of an immune variant of the prion protein gene G127V versus non-immune alleles. The frequency of this genetic variant is due to the survival of immune persons

. About 14% of the variants are potentially harmful, and among those, 86% were 5,000 years old or younger. The researchers also found that European Americans had accumulated a much larger number of mutations than African Americans. This is likely a consequence of their ancestors' migration out of Africa, which resulted in a genetic bottleneck; there were few mates available

. The explosion of Toba, the largest volcanic eruption of the Quaternary, may have created a 1,000 year cold period, potentially reducing human populations to a few tropical refugia. It has been estimated that as few as 15,000 humans survived. In such circumstances genetic drift and founder effects may have been maximised. The greater diversity amongst African genomes may reflect the extent of African refugia during the Toba incident

What is the expected outcome of PCOS on fertility?,reduces fertility,". Some reported trends remain unexplained and the subject of ongoing research in the novel field of evolutionary medicine: polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) reduces fertility and thus is expected to be subject to extremely strong negative selection, but its relative commonality in human populations suggests a counteracting selection pressure.

What is an example of how cultural evolution can defy the expectations of natural selection?,"The observed selection for producing children at older ages due to the advent of effective contraception, higher education, and changing social norms",". Culturally-driven evolution can defy the expectations of natural selection: while human populations experience some pressure that drives a selection for producing children at younger ages, the advent of effective contraception, higher education, and changing social norms have driven the observed selection in the opposite direction

. However, culturally-driven selection need not necessarily work counter or in opposition to natural selection: some proposals to explain the high rate of recent human brain expansion indicate a kind of feedback whereupon the brain's increased social learning efficiency encourages cultural developments that in turn encourage more efficiency, which drive more complex cultural developments that demand still-greater efficiency, and so forth

The first period of brain expansion occurred 2.5 million years ago, when Homo habilis first began using stone tools. The second period occurred 500,000 years ago, with the emergence of archaic Homo sapiens

. Increasing brain size has also been significant in human evolution. It began to increase approximately 2.4 million years ago, but modern levels of brain size were not attained until after 500,000 years ago. Zoological analyses have shown that the size of human brains is significantly larger than what anatomists would expect for their size. The human brain is three to four times larger than its closest relative, which is the chimpanzee

"What type of evolution is observed in the archaeological record, connecting to culturally-driven cognitive development?",Culturally-driven evolution,". Culturally-driven evolution has an advantage in that in addition to the genetic effects, it can be observed also in the archaeological record: the development of stone tools across the Palaeolithic period connects to culturally-driven cognitive development in the form of skill acquisition supported by the culture and the development of increasingly complex technologies and the cognitive ability to elaborate them

What is the Latin meaning of the biological genus to which humans belong?,Human,". The term ""hominin"" refers to any genus in the human tribe (Hominini), of which Homo sapiens (modern humans) is the only living specimen. In 1758 Carl Linnaeus introduced the name Homo sapiens as a species name in the 10th edition of his work Systema Naturae although without a scientific description of the species-specific characteristics

.[f] The English word human is from the Latin humanus, the adjectival form of homo. The Latin homo derives from the Indo-European root *dhghem, or 'earth'. Linnaeus and other scientists of his time also considered the great apes to be the closest relatives of humans based on morphological and anatomical similarities

. In contemporary times, since industrialization, some trends have been observed: for instance, menopause is evolving to occur later. Other reported trends appear to include lengthening of the human reproductive period and reduction in cholesterol levels, blood glucose and blood pressure in some populations.

What is the origin of the Latin word 'homo'?,"The Indo-European root *dhghem, or 'earth'",".[f] The English word human is from the Latin humanus, the adjectival form of homo. The Latin homo derives from the Indo-European root *dhghem, or 'earth'. Linnaeus and other scientists of his time also considered the great apes to be the closest relatives of humans based on morphological and anatomical similarities

. Separate archaic (non-sapiens) human species including Neanderthals are thought to have survived until around 40,000 years ago. The Latin noun homō (genitive hominis) means ""human being"" or ""man"" in the generic sense of ""human being, mankind"".[c] The binomial name Homo sapiens was coined by Carl Linnaeus (1758).[d] Names for other species of the genus were introduced from the second half of the 19th century (H. neanderthalensis 1864, H. erectus 1892)

When was Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species published?,1859,". The possibility of linking humans with earlier apes by descent became clear only after 1859 with the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, in which he argued for the idea of the evolution of new species from earlier ones. Darwin's book did not address the question of human evolution, saying only that ""Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."" The first debates about the nature of human evolution arose between Thomas Henry Huxley and Richard Owen

. The modern field of paleoanthropology began in the 19th century with the discovery of ""Neanderthal man"" (the eponymous skeleton was found in 1856, but there had been finds elsewhere since 1830), and with evidence of so-called cave men. The idea that humans are similar to certain great apes had been obvious to people for some time, but the idea of the biological evolution of species in general was not legitimized until after Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859

At that time, brain evolution was","According to the context, Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species was published in 1859.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.8,"The LLM correctly identifies the year of publication, but it provides no information about the context or the significance of the work in that year."
Who published a book called 'Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature' in 1863?,T.H. Huxley,". Huxley convincingly illustrated many of the similarities and differences between humans and apes in his 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. By the time Darwin published his own book on the subject, Descent of Man, it was already a well-known interpretation of his theory—and the interpretation which made the theory highly controversial

. Huxley argued for human evolution from apes by illustrating many of the similarities and differences between humans and other apes, and did so particularly in his 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Many of Darwin's early supporters (such as Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Lyell) did not initially agree that the origin of the mental capacities and the moral sensibilities of humans could be explained by natural selection, though this later changed

. The science arguably began in the late 19th century when important discoveries occurred that led to the study of human evolution. The discovery of the Neanderthal in Germany, Thomas Huxley's Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature, and Charles Darwin's The Descent of Man were both important to early paleoanthropological research

In what year did Darwin apply the theory of evolution and sexual selection to humans?,1871,". Darwin applied the theory of evolution and sexual selection to humans in his 1871 book The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. A major problem in the 19th century was the lack of fossil intermediaries

. The role of sexual selection in human evolution has been considered controversial from the moment of publication of Darwin's book on sexual selection (1871)

."" Charles Darwin conjectured that the male beard, as well as the hairlessness of humans compared to nearly all other mammals, were results of sexual selection. He reasoned that since the bodies of females are more nearly hairless, the loss of fur was due to sexual selection of females at a remote prehistoric time when males had overwhelming selective power, and that it nonetheless affected males due to genetic correlation between the sexes

The possibility of linking humans with earlier apes by descent became clear only after 1859 with the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, in which he argued for the idea of the evolution of new species from earlier ones.

The correct date of Darwin's publication is 1859, not 1871."
When were Neanderthal remains first discovered?,1856,". Neanderthal remains were discovered in a limestone quarry in 1856, three years before the publication of On the Origin of Species, and Neanderthal fossils had been discovered in Gibraltar even earlier, but it was originally claimed that these were the remains of a modern human who had suffered some kind of illness

. Neanderthal evidence has also been found quite late at 33,000 years ago at the 65th latitude of the Byzovaya site in the Ural Mountains. This is far outside of any otherwise known habitat, during a high ice cover period, and perhaps reflects a refugia of near extinction. Homo sapiens are believed to have emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago, based in part on thermoluminescence dating of artifacts and remains from Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, published in 2017

Who described Australopithecus africanus in 1925?,Raymond Dart,". Despite the 1891 discovery by Eugène Dubois of what is now called Homo erectus at Trinil, Java, it was only in the 1920s when such fossils were discovered in Africa, that intermediate species began to accumulate. In 1925, Raymond Dart described Australopithecus africanus. The type specimen was the Taung Child, an australopithecine infant which was discovered in a cave. The child's remains were a remarkably well-preserved tiny skull and an endocast of the brain

. The first Australopithecus specimen, the type specimen, was discovered in 1924 in a lime quarry by workers at Taung, South Africa. The specimen was studied by the Australian anatomist Raymond Dart, who was then working at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. The fossil skull was from a three-year-old bipedal primate (nicknamed Taung Child) that he named Australopithecus africanus. The first report was published in Nature in February 1925

. In 1924 in a limestone quarry at Taung, Professor Raymond Dart discovered a remarkably well-preserved juvenile specimen (face and brain endocast), which he named Australopithecus africanus (Australopithecus meaning ""Southern Ape""). Although the brain was small (410 cm3","According to the context, Raymond Dart described Australopithecus africanus in 1925.",1.0,0.8,0.7,0.9,0.0,The context clearly describes Raymond Dart as the one who described Australopithecus africanus in 1925.
What was unique about the shape of the Taung Child's brain compared to chimpanzees and gorillas?,"It was rounded, unlike that of chimpanzees and gorillas",". Although the brain was small (410 cm3), its shape was rounded, unlike that of chimpanzees and gorillas, and more like a modern human brain. Also, the specimen showed short canine teeth, and the position of the foramen magnum (the hole in the skull where the spine enters) was evidence of bipedal locomotion. All of these traits convinced Dart that the Taung Child was a bipedal human ancestor, a transitional form between apes and humans

. In addition, the specimen exhibited short canine teeth, and the anterior placement of the foramen magnum was more like the placement seen in modern humans than the placement seen in chimpanzees and gorillas, suggesting that this species was bipedal.

What region in East Africa was the site of numerous fossil discoveries by the Leakey family during the 1960s and 1970s?,Olduvai Gorge and Lake Turkana,". During the 1960s and 1970s, hundreds of fossils were found in East Africa in the regions of the Olduvai Gorge and Lake Turkana. These searches were carried out by the Leakey family, with Louis Leakey and his wife Mary Leakey, and later their son Richard and daughter-in-law Meave, fossil hunters and paleoanthropologists. From the fossil beds of Olduvai and Lake Turkana they amassed specimens of the early hominins: the australopithecines and Homo species, and even H. erectus

. In 1960, the Leakeys discovered the fossil OH 7, also at Olduvai Gorge, and assigned it to a new species, Homo habilis. In 1972, Bernard Ngeneo, a fieldworker working for Richard Leakey, discovered the fossil KNM-ER 1470 near Lake Turkana in Kenya. KNM-ER 1470 has been interpreted as either a distinct species, Homo rudolfensis, or alternatively as evidence of sexual dimorphism in Homo habilis

. A more recent consensus has been to return to the original classification of Paranthropus as a separate genus.

What was Lucy classified as?,Australopithecus afarensis,". Although the specimen had a small brain, the pelvis and leg bones were almost identical in function to those of modern humans, showing with certainty that these hominins had walked erect. Lucy was classified as a new species, Australopithecus afarensis, which is thought to be more closely related to the genus Homo as a direct ancestor, or as a close relative of an unknown ancestor, than any other known hominid or hominin from this early time range

. For example, Lucy, the famous Australopithecus afarensis, found in Hadar in Ethiopia, which may have been forested at the time of Lucy's death, had curved fingers that would still give her the ability to grasp tree branches, but she walked bipedally. ""Little Foot"", a nearly-complete specimen of Australopithecus africanus, has a divergent big toe as well as the ankle strength to walk upright. ""Little Foot"" could grasp things using his feet like an ape, perhaps tree branches, and he was bipedal

. This specimen was assigned to another species, Paranthropus aethiopicus. In 1994, a team led by Meave Leakey announced a new species, Australopithecus anamensis, based on specimens found near Lake Turkana.

What was the nickname given to a specimen found in the Afar Triangle area?,Lucy,". For example, in 2001, Zeresenay Alemseged discovered an Australopithecus afarensis child fossil, called Selam, from the site of Dikika in the Afar region of Ethiopia. This find is particularly important because the fossil included a preserved hyoid bone, something rarely found in other paleoanthropological fossils but important for understanding the evolution of speech capacities. Two new species from southern Africa have been discovered and described in recent years

. On October 1, 2009, paleontologists formally announced the discovery of the relatively complete A. ramidus fossil skeleton first unearthed in 1994. The fossil is the remains of a small-brained 50-kilogram (110 lb) female, nicknamed ""Ardi"", and includes most of the skull and teeth, as well as the pelvis, hands, and feet.

What is unique about the skeletal anatomy of this species?,It combines primitive features known from australopithecines with features known from early hominins.,". The species is characterized by a body mass and stature similar to small-bodied human populations, a smaller endocranial volume similar to Australopithecus, and a cranial morphology (skull shape) similar to early Homo species.

The hypothesis of pathological dwarfism, however, fails to explain additional anatomical features that are unlike those of modern humans (diseased or not) but much like those of ancient members of our genus. Aside from cranial features, these features include the form of bones in the wrist, forearm, shoulder, knees, and feet

... is not the claim that such features do not appear elsewhere; the genetic structure of the human species makes such a possibility unlikely to the extreme. There may be uniqueness in combinations of traits, but no single trait is likely to have been unique in a particular part of the world although it might appear to be so because of the incomplete sampling provided by the spotty human fossil record

When did the fossils date back to?,"250,000 years ago",". The early fossils shown are not considered ancestors to Homo sapiens but are closely related to ancestors and are therefore important to the study of the lineage. After 1.5 million years ago (extinction of Paranthropus), all fossils shown are human (genus Homo). After 11,500 years ago (11.5 ka, beginning of the Holocene), all fossils shown are Homo sapiens (anatomically modern humans), illustrating recent divergence in the formation of modern human sub-populations

. This very early migration into Australia is also supported by Rasmussen et al. (2011). Fossils from Lake Mungo, Australia, have been dated to about 42,000 years ago. Other fossils from a site called Madjedbebe have been dated to at least 65,000 years ago, though some researchers doubt this early estimate and date the Madjedbebe fossils at about 50,000 years ago at the oldest

What is the strength of the reaction expressed numerically?,Immunological distance (ID),". The strength of the reaction could be expressed numerically as an immunological distance, which was in turn proportional to the number of amino acid differences between homologous proteins in different species. By constructing a calibration curve of the ID of species' pairs with known divergence times in the fossil record, the data could be used as a molecular clock to estimate the times of divergence of pairs with poorer or unknown fossil records

. The way to accurately estimate the average strength of positive selection acting on the human genome is by inferring the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new advantageous mutations in the human genome, but this DFE is difficult to infer because new advantageous mutations are very rare (Boyko et al. 2008). The DFE may be exponential shaped in an adapted population (Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2007)

. The two alternative hypotheses are a relative absence of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN < dS; ω < 1), suggesting the effect on fitness ('fitness effect', or 'selection pressure') of such mutations is negative (purifying selection has operated over time); or a relative excess of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN > dS; ω > 1), indicat","According to the context, the strength of the reaction can be expressed numerically as an immunological distance (ID).",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.8,0.9,"The context does mention the use of an immunological distance, but the LLM's answer is not specific about the numerical value or units used."
When did Sarich and Wilson estimate the divergence time of humans and apes in their 1967 paper?,Four to five million years ago,". In their seminal 1967 paper in Science, Sarich and Wilson estimated the divergence time of humans and apes as four to five million years ago, at a time when standard interpretations of the fossil record gave this divergence as at least 10 to as much as 30 million years. Subsequent fossil discoveries, notably ""Lucy"", and reinterpretation of older fossil materials, notably Ramapithecus, showed the younger estimates to be correct and validated the albumin method

. The fossils were dated close to 250,000 years ago, and thus are not ancestral but contemporary with the first appearance of larger-brained anatomically modern humans. The genetic revolution in studies of human evolution started when Vincent Sarich and Allan Wilson measured the strength of immunological cross-reactions of blood serum albumin between pairs of creatures, including humans and African apes (chimpanzees and gorillas)

. The chimpanzee–human divergence likely took place around 10 to 7 million years ago. The list of fossils begins with Graecopithecus, dated some 7.2 million years ago, which may or may not still be ancestral to both the human and the chimpanzee lineage.

What type of DNA was sequenced after mitochondrial DNA in the context of studying human origins?,Y-chromosome DNA (Y-DNA),". Progress in DNA sequencing, specifically mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and then Y-chromosome DNA (Y-DNA) advanced the understanding of human origins. Application of the molecular clock principle revolutionized the study of molecular evolution

. Sequencing mtDNA and Y-DNA sampled from a wide range of indigenous populations revealed ancestral information relating to both male and female genetic heritage, and strengthened the ""out of Africa"" theory and weakened the views of multiregional evolutionism. Aligned in genetic tree differences were interpreted as supportive of a recent single origin. ""Out of Africa"" has thus gained much support from research using female mitochondrial DNA and the male Y chromosome

. While the divergence point of the mtDNA was unexpectedly deep in time, the full genomic sequence suggested the Denisovans belonged to the same lineage as Neanderthals, with the two diverging shortly after their line split from the lineage that gave rise to modern humans

. To identify informative genetic markers for tracking human evolutionary history, Wilson concentrated on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is maternally inherited. This DNA material mutates quickly, making it eas","According to the context, Y-chromosome DNA (Y-DNA) was sequenced after mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.9,"The context suggests that mtDNA was sequenced prior to Y-DNA, not the other way around."
How many mutations per generation did earlier studies suggest were not inherited by human children from their parents?,76,". On the basis of a separation from the orangutan between 10 and 20 million years ago, earlier studies of the molecular clock suggested that there were about 76 mutations per generation that were not inherited by human children from their parents; this evidence supported the divergence time between hominins and chimpanzees noted above

. A 2012 study led by Augustin Kong suggests that the number of de novo (new) mutations increases by about two per year of delayed reproduction by the father and that the total number of paternal mutations doubles every 16.5 years. For a long time, medicine has reduced the fatality of genetic defects and contagious diseases, allowing more and more humans to survive and reproduce, but it has also enabled maladaptive traits that would otherwise be culled to accumulate in the gene pool

Additional research with 226 offspring of wild chimpanzee populations in eight locations suggests that chimpanzees reproduce at age 26.5 years on average; which suggests the human divergence from chimpanzees occurred between 7 and 13 mya

. Chimpanzees live in fission-fusion groups that average 50 individuals. It is likely that early ancestors of humans lived in groups of similar size. Based on the size of extant hunter-gatherer societies, recent Paleolithic hominids lived in bands of a few hundred individuals. As community size increased over the course of human evolution, greater enforcement to achieve group cohesion would have been required

. According to the Chimpanzee Genome Project, the human–chimpanzee last common ancestor existed about five to six million years ago, assuming a constant rate of mutation.

What is the age of the bipedal hominin Orrorin tugenensis discovered in 2000?,6 million years ago,". In 1994, Meave Leakey discovered Australopithecus anamensis. The find was overshadowed by Tim D. White's 1995 discovery of Ardipithecus ramidus, which pushed back the fossil record to 4.2 million years ago. In 2000, Martin Pickford and Brigitte Senut discovered, in the Tugen Hills of Kenya, a 6-million-year-old bipedal hominin which they named Orrorin tugenensis. And in 2001, a team led by Michel Brunet discovered the skull of Sahelanthropus tchadensis which was dated as 7

. In 2000, Brigitte Senut and Martin Pickford described the species Orrorin tugenensis, based on fossils they found in Kenya. In 2004, Yohannes Haile-Selassie announced that some specimens previously labeled as Ardipithecus ramidus made up a different species, Ardipithecus kadabba. In 2015, Haile-Selassie announced another new species, Australopithecus deyiremeda, though some scholars are skeptical that the associated fossils truly represent a unique species

. A member of the Australopithecus afarensis left human-like footprints on volcanic ash in Laetoli, northern Tanzania, providing strong evidence of full-time bipedalism.

When did Brunet argue a bipedal species was a hominin?,.2 million years ago,".2 million years ago, and which Brunet argued was a bipedal, and therefore a hominid—that is, a hominin (cf Hominidae; terms ""hominids"" and hominins). Anthropologists in the 1980s were divided regarding some details of reproductive barriers and migratory dispersals of the genus Homo. Subsequently, genetics has been used to investigate and resolve these issues

.5 million years ago (mya). The earliest evidence of fundamentally bipedal hominins is a (3.6 mya) fossil trackway in Laetoli, Tanzania, which bears a remarkable similarity to those of modern humans. The footprints have generally been classified as australopith, as they are the only form of prehuman hominins known to have existed in that region at that time

. In 1967, Richard Leakey reported the earliest definitive examples of anatomically modern Homo sapiens from the site of Omo Kibish in Ethiopia, known as the Omo remains. In the late 1970s, Mary Leakey excavated the famous Laetoli footprints in Tanzania, which demonstrated the antiquity of bipedality in the human lineage. In 1985, Richard Leakey and Alan Walker discovered a specimen they called the Black Skull, found near Lake Turkana

The context only mentions Brunet's argument, and the LLM does not provide any additional information to support its claim."
"How many times did the genus Homo migrate out of Africa, according to the Sahara pump theory?",At least three,". According to the Sahara pump theory evidence suggests that the genus Homo have migrated out of Africa at least three and possibly four times (e.g. Homo erectus, Homo heidelbergensis and two or three times for Homo sapiens). Recent evidence suggests these dispersals are closely related to fluctuating periods of climate change. Recent evidence suggests that humans may have left Africa half a million years earlier than previously thought

. The Sahara pump theory (describing an occasionally passable ""wet"" Sahara desert) provides one possible explanation of the intermittent migration and speciation in the genus Homo. Based on archaeological and paleontological evidence, it has been possible to infer, to some extent, the ancient dietary practices of various Homo species and to study the role of diet in physical and behavioral evolution within Homo

. This migration has been proposed as being related to the operation of the Saharan pump, around 1.9 million years ago. Homo erectus dispersed throughout most of the Old World, reaching as far as Southeast Asia. Its distribution is traced by the Oldowan lithic industry, by 1.3 million years ago extending as far north as the 40th parallel (X","According to the context, the Sahara pump theory suggests that the genus Homo migrated out of Africa at least three and possibly four times.",1.0,0.7,0.8,0.5,0.0,The LLM correctly states that the Sahara pump theory suggests that the genus Homo migrated out of Africa at least three and possibly four times.
What is the estimated age of human artifacts found in the Siwalk Hills north of New Delhi?,At least 2.6 million years,". A joint Franco-Indian team has found human artifacts in the Siwalk Hills north of New Delhi dating back at least 2.6 million years. This is earlier than the previous earliest finding of genus Homo at Dmanisi, in Georgia, dating to 1.85 million years. Although controversial, tools found at a Chinese cave strengthen the case that humans used tools as far back as 2.48 million years ago

. Early Eurasian Homo sapiens fossils have been found in Apidima Cave (Greece) and Misliya Cave (Israel), dated to 210,000 and 194,000–177,000 years old respectively. These fossils seem to represent failed dispersal attempts by early Homo sapiens, who were likely replaced by local Neanderthal populations

When did modern humans leave Africa?,.48 million years ago,". There is some evidence that modern humans left Africa at least 125,000 years ago using two different routes: through the Nile Valley, the Sinai Peninsula and the Levant (Qafzeh Cave: 120,000–100,000 years ago); and a second route through the present-day Bab-el-Mandeb Strait on the Red Sea (at that time, with a much lower sea level and narrower extension), crossing to the Arabian Peninsula and settling in places like the present-day United Arab Emirates (125,000 years ago) and Oman (106,000

Who proposed the multiregional hypothesis in 1988?,Milford H. Wolpoff,". This differs from the multiregional hypothesis in that the multiregional model predicts interbreeding with preexisting local human populations in any such migration."" The Multiregional hypothesis was proposed in 1984 by Milford H. Wolpoff, Alan Thorne and Xinzhi Wu. Wolpoff credits Franz Weidenreich's ""Polycentric"" hypothesis of human origins as a major influence, but cautions that this should not be confused with polygenism, or Carleton Coon's model that minimized gene flow

. The multiregional hypothesis was first proposed in 1984, and then revised in 2003. In its revised form, it is similar to the assimilation model, which holds that modern humans originated in Africa and today share a predominant recent African origin, but have also absorbed small, geographically variable, degrees of admixture from other regional (archaic) hominin species. The multiregional hypothesis is not currently the most accepted theory of modern human origin among scientists

When did the speciation of Homo sapiens occur?,"Approximately 200,000 years ago",". sapiens speciated in Africa recently (that is, approximately 200,000 years ago) and the subsequent migration through Eurasia resulted in the nearly complete replacement of other Homo species. This model has been developed by Chris Stringer and Peter Andrews

. Different chromosomes appear to have split at different times, possibly over as much as a 4-million-year period, indicating a long and drawn out speciation process with large-scale gene flow events between the two emerging lineages as recently as 6.3 to 5.4 million years ago, according to Patterson et al. (2006). Speciation between Pan and Homo occurred over the last 9 million years. Ardipithecus probably branched off of the Pan lineage in the middle Miocene Messinian

. Between 400,000 years ago and the second interglacial period in the Middle Pleistocene, around 250,000 years ago, the trend in intra-cranial volume expansion and the elaboration of stone tool technologies developed, providing evidence for a transition from H. erectus to H. sapiens. The direct evidence suggests there was a migration of H. erectus out of Africa, then a further speciation of H. sapiens from H. erectus in Africa

What does the sequencing of mtDNA and Y-DNA reveal about the origins of human populations?,Ancestral information relating to both male and female genetic heritage,". Sequencing mtDNA and Y-DNA sampled from a wide range of indigenous populations revealed ancestral information relating to both male and female genetic heritage, and strengthened the ""out of Africa"" theory and weakened the views of multiregional evolutionism. Aligned in genetic tree differences were interpreted as supportive of a recent single origin. ""Out of Africa"" has thus gained much support from research using female mitochondrial DNA and the male Y chromosome

. Progress in DNA sequencing, specifically mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and then Y-chromosome DNA (Y-DNA) advanced the understanding of human origins. Application of the molecular clock principle revolutionized the study of molecular evolution

. However, the mitochondrial and Y chromosome data could not be explained by the same modern human expansion out of Africa; the Y chromosome expansion would have involved genetic mixing that retained regionally local mitochondrial lines. In addition, the Y chromosome data indicated a later expansion back into Africa from Asia, demonstrating that gene flow between regions was not unidirectional

"According to genealogy trees constructed using mtDNA, how many types of mtDNA were analyzed?",133,". After analysing genealogy trees constructed using 133 types of mtDNA, researchers concluded that all were descended from a female African progenitor, dubbed Mitochondrial Eve. ""Out of Africa"" is also supported by the fact that mitochondrial genetic diversity is highest among African populations

Sequencing mtDNA and Y-DNA sampled from a wide range of indigenous populations revealed ancestral information relating to both male and female genetic heritage, and strengthened the ""out of Africa"" theory and weakened the views of multiregional evolutionism. Aligned in genetic tree differences were interpreted as supportive of a recent single origin. ""Out of Africa"" has thus gained much support from research using female mitochondrial DNA and the male Y chromosome

. The relationship between such gene trees and demographic history is still debated when applied to dispersals. Of all the lineages present in Africa, the female descendants of only one lineage, mtDNA haplogroup L3, are found outside Africa.

What was found to be the ancestral population cluster with the greatest genetic diversity among 113 distinct populations?,The San people,". A broad study of African genetic diversity, headed by Sarah Tishkoff, found the San people had the greatest genetic diversity among the 113 distinct populations sampled, making them one of 14 ""ancestral population clusters"". The research also located a possible origin of modern human migration in southwestern Africa, near the coastal border of Namibia and Angola

. It has been suggested by various studies that populations were geographically “structured” to some degree prior to the expansion out of Africa; this is suggested by the antiquity of shared mtDNA lineages. One study of 121 populations from various places throughout the continent found 14 genetic and linguistic “clusters,” suggesting an ancient geographic structure to African populations

. A 2002 study of African, European, and Asian populations, found greater genetic diversity among Africans than among Eurasians, and that genetic diversity among Eurasians is largely a subset of that among Africans, supporting the out of Africa model.

What type of DNA studies support a Recent African origin for modern humans?,"Y-chromosomal DNA, mitochondrial DNA, and autosomal DNA",". The fossil evidence was insufficient for archaeologist Richard Leakey to resolve the debate about exactly where in Africa modern humans first appeared. Studies of haplogroups in Y-chromosomal DNA and mitochondrial DNA have largely supported a recent African origin. All the evidence from autosomal DNA also predominantly supports a Recent African origin

. Recent genetic evidence suggests that all modern non-African populations, including those of Eurasia and Oceania, are descended from a single wave that left Africa between 65,000 and 50,000 years ago. The evidence on which scientific accounts of human evolution are based comes from many fields of natural science

. However, a recent review highlights that the single-source hypothesis of non-African populations is less consistent with ancient DNA analysis than multiple sources with genetic mixing across Eurasia. The recent expansion of anatomically modern humans reached Europe around 40,000 years ago from Central Asia and the Middle East, as a result of cultural adaption to big game hunting of sub-glacial steppe fauna

What percentage of Neanderthal alleles do modern human groups outside Africa typically have in their genome?,1-4%,". However, evidence for archaic admixture in modern humans, both in Africa and later, throughout Eurasia has recently been suggested by a number of studies. Recent sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes shows that some admixture with these populations has occurred. All modern human groups outside Africa have 1–4% or (according to more recent research) about 1.5–2.6% Neanderthal alleles in their genome, and some Melanesians have an additional 4–6% of Denisovan alleles

. Today, approximately 2% of DNA from all non-African populations (including Europeans, Asians, and Oceanians) is Neanderthal, with traces of Denisovan heritage. Also, 4–6% of modern Melanesian genetics are Denisovan. Comparisons of the human genome to the genomes of Neandertals, Denisovans and apes can help identify features that set modern humans apart from other hominin species

. The earliest analyses were of Neanderthal DNA, and indicated that the Neanderthal contribution to modern human genetic diversity was no more than 20%, with a most likely value of 0%. By 2010, however, detailed DNA sequencing of the Neanderthal specimens from Europe indicated that the contribution was nonzero, with Neanderthals sh","According to the context, modern human groups outside Africa typically have 1-4% or (according to more recent research) about 1.5-2.6% Neanderthal alleles in their genome.",0.85,0.85,0.95,0.75,0.0,"The answer is mostly correct, but it could be improved by providing a more specific range of values for the Neanderthal allele percentage, and by explaining that the context is limited to modern human groups outside Africa."

What is one of the theories that explains how humans spread out of Africa?,A multiple dispersal model,". --- # Recent African origin of modern humans In paleoanthropology, the recent African origin of modern humans or the ""Out of Africa"" theory (OOA)[a] is the most widely accepted model of the geographic origin and early migration of anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens). It follows the early expansions of hominins out of Africa, accomplished by Homo erectus and then Homo neanderthalensis

.[note 1] The recent African origin theory suggests that the anatomically modern humans outside of Africa descend from a population of Homo sapiens migrating from East Africa roughly 70–50,000 years ago and spreading along the southern coast of Asia and to Oceania by about 50,000 years ago. Modern humans spread across Europe about 40,000 years ago

When did modern humans cross the Bab el Mandib from the Horn of Africa?,"around 70,000 years ago",". In this theory, there was a coastal dispersal of modern humans from the Horn of Africa crossing the Bab el Mandib to Yemen at a lower sea level around 70,000 years ago. This group helped to populate Southeast Asia and Oceania, explaining the discovery of early human sites in these areas much earlier than those in the Levant. This group seems to have been dependent upon marine resources for their survival

. There is some evidence that modern humans left Africa at least 125,000 years ago using two different routes: through the Nile Valley, the Sinai Peninsula and the Levant (Qafzeh Cave: 120,000–100,000 years ago); and a second route through the present-day Bab-el-Mandeb Strait on the Red Sea (at that time, with a much lower sea level and narrower extension), crossing to the Arabian Peninsula and settling in places like the present-day United Arab Emirates (125,000 years ago) and Oman (106,000

. As of 2010, there were two main accepted dispersal routes for the out-of-Africa migration of early anatomically modern humans, the ""Northern Route"" (via Nile Valley and Sinai) and the ""Southern Route"" via the Bab-el-Mandeb strait.

What is the approximate time period when a second wave of humans may have dispersed through the Persian Gulf oases and the Middle East?,"around 50,000 years BP",". Stephen Oppenheimer has proposed a second wave of humans may have later dispersed through the Persian Gulf oases, and the Zagros mountains into the Middle East. Alternatively it may have come across the Sinai Peninsula into Asia, from shortly after 50,000 yrs BP, resulting in the bulk of the human populations of Eurasia

. On the basis of the early date of Badoshan Iranian Aurignacian, Oppenheimer suggests that this second dispersal may have occurred with a pluvial period about 50,000 years before the present, with modern human big-game hunting cultures spreading up the Zagros Mountains, carrying modern human genomes from Oman, throughout the Persian Gulf, northward into Armenia and Anatolia, with a variant travelling south into Israel and to Cyrenicia

What is suggested to be a characteristic of the second group compared to the original group?,More sophisticated 'big game hunting' tool technology,". These two properties, rare in genetic transmission, are necessary for group selection to operate. Based on an earlier model by Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, Boyd and Richerson show that conformist biases are almost inevitable when traits spread through social learning, implying that group selection is common in cultural evolution

. Analysis of small groups in New Guinea imply that cultural group selection might be a good explanation for slowly changing aspects of social structure, but not for rapidly changing fads. The ability of cultural evolution to maintain intergroup diversity is what allows for the study of cultural phylogenetics

. It has been suggested that this second group possibly possessed a more sophisticated ""big game hunting"" tool technology and was less dependent on coastal food sources than the original group. Much of the evidence for the first group's expansion would have been destroyed by the rising sea levels at the end of each glacial maximum

. It has been suggested that this second group possibly possessed a more sophisticated ""big game hunting"" tool technology and was less dependent on coastal food sources than the original group. Much of the evidence for the first group's expansion would have been destroyed by the rising sea levels at the end of each glacial maximum

What is the estimated time range for the migration of modern non-African populations out of Africa?,"65,000 to 50,000 years ago",". Some research showing slower than expected genetic mutations in human DNA was published in 2012, indicating a revised dating for the migration to between 90,000 and 130,000 years ago. Some more recent research suggests a migration out-of-Africa of around 50,000-65,000 years ago of the ancestors of modern non-African populations, similar to most previous estimates. Following the fossils dating 80,000 to 120,000 years ago from Qafzeh and Es-Skhul Caves in Israel there are no H

Modern humans spread across Europe about 40,000 years ago

. Recent genetic evidence suggests that all modern non-African populations, including those of Eurasia and Oceania, are descended from a single wave that left Africa between 65,000 and 50,000 years ago.

What is one of the main sources of knowledge about the evolutionary process?,The fossil record,". The main source of knowledge about the evolutionary process has traditionally been the fossil record, but since the development of genetics beginning in the 1970s, DNA analysis has come to occupy a place of comparable importance. The studies of ontogeny, phylogeny and especially evolutionary developmental biology of both vertebrates and invertebrates offer considerable insight into the evolution of all life, including how humans evolved

. Evolutionary psychologists also use various sources of data for testing, including experiments, archaeological records, data from hunter-gatherer societies, observational studies, neuroscience data, self-reports and surveys, public records, and human products. Recently, additional methods and tools have been introduced based on fictional scenarios, mathematical models, and multi-agent computer simulations

What percentage of DNA sequence similarity has been estimated between human and chimpanzee genomes as of 2012?,Between 95% and 99%,". Human DNA is approximately 98.4% identical to that of chimpanzees when comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms (see human evolutionary genetics). The fossil record, however, of gorillas and chimpanzees is limited; both poor preservation – rain forest soils tend to be acidic and dissolve bone – and sampling bias probably contribute to this problem

. Comparing a given gene with that of other species enables geneticists to determine whether it is rapidly evolving in humans alone. For example, while human DNA is on average 98% identical to chimp DNA, the so-called Human Accelerated Region 1 (HAR1), involved in the development of the brain, is only 85% similar

. An estimate of 10 to 13 million years for the CHLCA was proposed in 1998, and a range of 7 to 10 million years ago is assumed by White and colleagues in 2009. A 2016 study analyzed transitions at CpG sites in genome sequences, which exhibit a more clocklike behavior than other substitutions, arriving at an estimate for human and chimpanzee divergence time of 12.1 million years. Studies in the early 2020s suggest a more recent CHLCA, such as between 9.3 and 6

What percentage of DNA do mice share with humans?,97.5%,". It is also noteworthy that mice share around 97.5% of their working DNA with humans. By using the technique called the molecular clock which estimates the time required for the number of divergent mutations to accumulate between two lineages, the approximate date for the split between lineages can be calculated

. At present estimate, humans have approximately 20,000–25,000 genes and share 99% of their DNA with the now extinct Neanderthal and 95–99% of their DNA with their closest living evolutionary relative, the chimpanzees.

When did the hominin and chimpanzee lineages split?,Between 4 to 8 million years ago,". The gibbons (family Hylobatidae) and then the orangutans (genus Pongo) were the first groups to split from the line leading to the hominins, including humans—followed by gorillas (genus Gorilla), and, ultimately, by the chimpanzees (genus Pan). The splitting date between hominin and chimpanzee lineages is placed by some between 4 to 8 million years ago, that is, during the Late Miocene. Speciation, however, appears to have been unusually drawn out

. The chimpanzee–human divergence likely took place around 10 to 7 million years ago. The list of fossils begins with Graecopithecus, dated some 7.2 million years ago, which may or may not still be ancestral to both the human and the chimpanzee lineage. For the earlier history of the human lineage, see Timeline of human evolution#Hominidae, Hominidae#Phylogeny

. This would put the CHLCA split in Southeast Europe instead of Africa. The earliest fossils clearly in the human but not the chimpanzee lineage appear between about 4.5 to 4 million years ago, with Australopithecus anamensis.

When did the final divergence occur in the context mentioned?,5 to 6 million years ago,". Initial divergence occurred sometime between 7 to 13 million years ago, but ongoing hybridization blurred the separation and delayed complete separation during several millions of years. Patterson (2006) dated the final divergence at 5 to 6 million years ago

. After the original divergences, there were, according to Patterson (2006), periods of gene flow between population groups and a process of alternating divergence and gene flow that lasted several million years. Some time during the late Miocene or early Pliocene, the earliest members of the human clade completed a final separation from the lineage of Pan – with date estimates ranging from 13 million to as recent as 4 million years ago

. Various recent divergence associated with environmental pressures, e.g. light skin in Europeans and East Asians (KITLG, ASIP), after 30 ka; Inuit adaptation to high-fat diet and cold climate, 20 ka. Extinction of late surviving archaic humans at the beginning of the Holocene (12 ka). Accelerated divergence due to selection pressures in populations participating in the Neolithic Revolution after 12 ka, e.g. East Asian types of ADH1B associated with rice domestication, or lactase persistence","According to the context, the final divergence occurred between 5 to 6 million years ago, as stated by Patterson (2006).",1.0,1.0,0.95,0.8,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the timeframe mentioned in the context as the final divergence, although the context is somewhat ambiguous and could be interpreted differently.

What is one way scientists use genetic evidence to compare species?,By comparing the parts of the genome that are not under natural selection and which therefore accumulate mutations at a fairly steady rate,". Genetic evidence has also been employed to compare species within the genus Homo, investigating gene flow between early modern humans and Neanderthals, and to enhance the understanding of the early human migration patterns and splitting dates. By comparing the parts of the genome that are not under natural selection and which therefore accumulate mutations at a fairly steady rate, it is possible to reconstruct a genetic tree incorporating the entire human species since the last shared ancestor

. Comparing a given gene with that of other species enables geneticists to determine whether it is rapidly evolving in humans alone. For example, while human DNA is on average 98% identical to chimp DNA, the so-called Human Accelerated Region 1 (HAR1), involved in the development of the brain, is only 85% similar

What forms a haplogroup?,A single-nucleotide polymorphism,". Each time a certain mutation (single-nucleotide polymorphism) appears in an individual and is passed on to his or her descendants, a haplogroup is formed including all of the descendants of the individual who will also carry that mutation

. It is also found among the Mbuti people. These groups branched off early in human history and have remained relatively genetically isolated since then. Haplogroups L1, L2, and L3 are descendants of L1–L6, and are largely confined to Africa. The macro haplogroups M and N, which are the lineages of the rest of the world outside Africa, descend from L3. L3 is about 70,000 years old, while haplogroups M and N are about 65–55,000 years old

. Results from mtDNA collected from aboriginal Malaysians called Orang Asli indicate that the haplogroups M and N share characteristics with original African groups from approximately 85,000 years ago, and share characteristics with sub-haplogroups found in coastal south-east Asian regions, such as Australasia, the Indian subcontinent and throughout continental Asia, which had dispersed and separated from their African progenitor approximately 65,000 years ago

"When did the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in all modern humans, also known as mitochondrial Eve, live?","200,000 years ago",". By comparing mitochondrial DNA which is inherited only from the mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in all modern humans, the so-called mitochondrial Eve, must have lived around 200,000 years ago. Human evolutionary genetics studies how human genomes differ among individuals, the evolutionary past that gave rise to them, and their current effects

. Wolpoff for example states that Eve is ""not the most recent common ancestor of all living people"" since ""Mitochondrial history is not population history"". Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from Feldhofer and Vindija Cave are substantially different from modern human mtDNA

. After analysing genealogy trees constructed using 133 types of mtDNA, researchers concluded that all were descended from a female African progenitor, dubbed Mitochondrial Eve. ""Out of Africa"" is also supported by the fact that mitochondrial genetic diversity is highest among African populations

. A Stanford University School of Medicine study was done by comparing Y-chromosome sequences and mtDNA in 69 men from different geographic regions and constructing a family tree. It was found ","According to the context, the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in all modern humans, also known as Mitochondrial Eve, must have lived around 200,000 years ago.",1.0,0.8,0.7,0.6,0.0,"The LLM generated answer is correct in stating that the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in all modern humans, also known as Mitochondrial Eve, must have lived around 200,000 years ago."

Distinctive human genetic variability has arisen as the result of the founder effect, by archaic admixture and by recent evolutionary pressures. Since Homo sapiens separated from its last common ancestor shared with chimpanzees, human evolution is characterized by a number of morphological, developmental, physiological, behavioral, and environmental changes

What is the estimated age of Sahelanthropus tchadensis?,7 million years ago,". Sahelanthropus tchadensis is an extinct hominine with some morphology proposed (and disputed) to be as expected of the CHLCA, and it lived some 7 million years ago – close to the time of the chimpanzee–human divergence

. Between 1999 and 2003, a multidisciplinary team led by Sileshi Semaw discovered bones and teeth of nine A. ramidus individuals at As Duma in the Gona area of Ethiopia's Afar Region. The fossils were dated to between 4.35 and 4.45 million years old. Ardipithecus ramidus had a small brain, measuring between 300 and 350 cm3

. According to the Chimpanzee Genome Project, the human–chimpanzee last common ancestor existed about five to six million years ago, assuming a constant rate of mutation. However, hominin species dated to earlier than the date could call this into question. Sahelanthropus tchadensis, commonly called ""Toumai"", is about seven million years old and Orrorin tugenensis lived at least six million years ago

What is the name of the lithic technology developed by H. habilis?,Oldowan,". The main reason to include H. habilis in Homo, its undisputed tool use, has become obsolete with the discovery of Australopithecus tool use at least a million years before H. habilis. Furthermore, H. habilis was long thought to be the ancestor of the more gracile Homo ergaster (Homo erectus). In 2007, it was discovered that H. habilis and H. erectus coexisted for a considerable time, suggesting that H. erectus is not immediately derived from H. habilis but instead from a common ancestor

. One of the first known hominins, it made tools from stone and perhaps animal bones, leading to its name homo habilis (Latin 'handy man') bestowed by discoverer Louis Leakey. Some scientists have proposed moving this species from Homo into Australopithecus due to the morphology of its skeleton being more adapted to living in trees rather than walking on two legs like later hominins. In May 2010, a new species, Homo gautengensis, was discovered in South Africa

Some scientists consider Homo rudolfensis, a larger bodied group of fossils with similar morphology to the original H. habilis fossils, to be a separate species, while others consider them to be part of H. habilis—simply representing intraspecies variation, or perhaps even sexual dimorphism. The brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee, and their main adaptation was bipedalism as an adaptation to terrestrial living

. After a period of stasis with Australopithecus anamensis and Ardipithecus, species which had smaller brains as a result of their bipedal locomotion, the pattern of encephalization started with Homo habilis, whose 600 cm3 (37 cu in) brain was slightly larger than that of chimpanzees.

When did the linear view of human evolution start to be abandoned?,The 1970s,". The linear view of human evolution began to be abandoned in the 1970s as different species of humans were discovered that made the linear concept increasingly unlikely. In the 21st century with the advent of molecular biology techniques and computerization, whole-genome sequencing of Neanderthal and human genome were performed, confirming recent admixture between different human species

. This view proposes that the derivation of anatomically modern human populations from H. erectus at the beginning of the Pleistocene 1.8 million years BP, has taken place within a continuous world population. The hypothesis necessarily rejects the assumption of an infertility barrier between ancient Eurasian and African populations of Homo. The hypothesis was controversially debated during the late 1980s and the 1990s

. Three were associated with the original expansion of Homo erectus out of Africa around 2 million years ago, 7 with an intermediate expansion out of Africa at a date consistent with the expansion of Acheulean tool technology, and a few others with other gene flows such as an expansion out of Eurasia and back into Africa subsequent to the most recent expansion out of Africa.

"What year was evidence based on molecular biology published, revealing unambiguous examples of interbreeding between archaic and modern humans?",2010,". In 2010, evidence based on molecular biology was published, revealing unambiguous examples of interbreeding between archaic and modern humans during the Middle Paleolithic and early Upper Paleolithic. It has been demonstrated that interbreeding happened in several independent events that included Neanderthals and Denisovans, as well as several unidentified hominins

. Evidence for archaic human species (descended from Homo heidelbergensis) having interbred with modern humans outside of Africa, was discovered in the 2010s. This concerns primarily Neanderthal admixture in all modern populations except for Sub-Saharan Africans but evidence has also been presented for Denisova hominin admixture in Australasia (i.e. in Melanesians, Aboriginal Australians and some Negritos)

. All these may have all contributed to modern Homo sapiens replacing Neanderthal populations by 28,000 BP. Earlier evidence from sequencing mitochondrial DNA suggested that no significant gene flow occurred between H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens, and that the two were separate species that shared a common ancestor about 660,000 years ago. However, a sequencing of the Neanderthal genome in 2010 indicated that N","According to the context, the answer is:

What percentage of DNA is Neanderthal in non-African populations?,2%,". Today, approximately 2% of DNA from all non-African populations (including Europeans, Asians, and Oceanians) is Neanderthal, with traces of Denisovan heritage. Also, 4–6% of modern Melanesian genetics are Denisovan. Comparisons of the human genome to the genomes of Neandertals, Denisovans and apes can help identify features that set modern humans apart from other hominin species

. The earliest analyses were of Neanderthal DNA, and indicated that the Neanderthal contribution to modern human genetic diversity was no more than 20%, with a most likely value of 0%. By 2010, however, detailed DNA sequencing of the Neanderthal specimens from Europe indicated that the contribution was nonzero, with Neanderthals sharing 1-4% more genetic variants with living non-Africans than with living humans in sub-Saharan Africa

. Though this interbred Romanian population seems not to have been ancestral to modern humans, the finding indicates that interbreeding happened repeatedly. All modern non-African humans have about 1% to 4% (or 1.5% to 2.6% by more recent data) of their DNA derived from Neanderthals. This finding is consistent with recent studies indicating that the divergence of some human ","According to the context, approximately 2% of DNA from all non-African populations (including Europeans, Asians, and Oceanians) is Neanderthal.",0.95,0.85,0.9,0.75,0.0,"The answer is mostly correct, but it could be improved by providing a range of non-African populations and by specifying the time period in which the DNA was collected."
What type of study was conducted by the Harvard Medical School/UCLA research team in 2016?,A comparative genomics study,". In a 2016 comparative genomics study, a Harvard Medical School/UCLA research team made a world map on the distribution and made some predictions about where Denisovan and Neanderthal genes may be impacting modern human biology

. Evolutionary biologist Hakhamanesh Mostafavi led a 2017 study that analyzed data of 215,000 individuals from just a few generations in the United Kingdom and the United States and found a number of genetic changes that affect longevity. The ApoE allele linked to Alzheimer's disease was rare among women aged 70 and over while the frequency of the CHRNA3 gene associated with smoking addiction among men fell among middle-aged men and up

Researchers participating in the Framingham Heart Study, which began in 1948 and was intended to investigate the cause of heart disease among women and their descendants in Framingham, Massachusetts, found evidence for selective pressures against high blood pressure due to the modern Western diet, which contains high amounts of salt, known for raising blood pressure. They also found evidence for selection against hypercholesterolemia, or high levels of cholesterol in the blood

What types of studies in the mid-2010s found traits related to various human phenotypes?,Comparative studies,". For example, comparative studies in the mid-2010s found several traits related to neurological, immunological, developmental, and metabolic phenotypes, that were developed by archaic humans to European and Asian environments and inherited to modern humans through admixture with local hominins

. A 2014 study reported that Neanderthal-derived variants found in East Asian populations showed clustering in functional groups related to immune and haematopoietic pathways, while European populations showed clustering in functional groups related to the lipid catabolic process.[note 1] A 2017 study found correlation of Neanderthal admixture in modern European populations with traits such as skin tone, hair color, height, sleeping patterns, mood and smoking addiction

. Further research also backs up the idea of using phenotypic traits as a means of assessing a potential mate's fitness for reproduction as well as assessing whether a partner has high genetic quality. One study proposed a link between Human Development Index levels and female preference for male facial appearance. While women from the United Kingdom preferred the faces of men with low cortisol levels, women from Latvia did ","Comparative studies in the mid-2010s found several traits related to neurological, immunological, developmental, and metabolic phenotypes.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.0,"The LLM provides a correct description of the topic, but it lacks specific details and fails to mention the scientific field in which the studies were conducted."
What is suggested by genomic research to be a common occurrence in human evolution?,Hybridization between substantially diverged lineages,". Although the narratives of human evolution are often contentious, several discoveries since 2010 show that human evolution should not be seen as a simple linear or branched progression, but a mix of related species. In fact, genomic research has shown that hybridization between substantially diverged lineages is the rule, not the exception, in human evolution. Furthermore, it is argued that hybridization was an essential creative force in the emergence of modern humans

. However, more research is required to produce more accurate estimates of the average strength of positive selection in humans, which will in turn improve the estimates of the amount of adaptive evolution occurring in the human genome (Boyko et al. 2008). A considerable number of studies have used genomic methods to identify specific human genes that show evidence of adaptive evolution

When did stone tools first appear?,2.6 million years ago,". Stone tools are first attested around 2.6 million years ago, when hominins in Eastern Africa used so-called core tools, choppers made out of round cores that had been split by simple strikes. This marks the beginning of the Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age; its end is taken to be the end of the last Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago

. Traditionally, the advent of Homo has been taken to coincide with the first use of stone tools (the Oldowan industry), and thus by definition with the beginning of the Lower Palaeolithic. But in 2010, evidence was presented that seems to attribute the use of stone tools to Australopithecus afarensis around 3.3 million years ago, close to a million years before the first appearance of Homo.

After 350,000 BP the more refined so-called Levallois technique was developed, a series of consecutive strikes, by which scrapers, slicers (""racloirs""), needles, and flattened needles were made. Finally, after about 50,000 BP, ever more refined and specialized flint tools were made by the Neanderthals and the immigrant Cro-Magnons (knives, blades, skimmers).

What is considered the modern synthesis of the process that Darwin and Wallace originally identified as the mechanism of evolution?,Evolutionary change,". This is the modern synthesis of the process which Darwin and Wallace originally identified as the mechanism of evolution. However, in the last half century, there has been considerable debate as to whether evolutionary changes at the molecular level are largely driven by natural selection or random genetic drift. Unsurprisingly, the forces which drive evolutionary changes in our own species’ lineage have been of particular interest

What is one purpose of quantifying adaptive evolution in the human genome?,It gives insights into our own evolutionary history and helps to resolve the neutralist-selectionist debate.,". Quantifying adaptive evolution in the human genome gives insights into our own evolutionary history and helps to resolve this neutralist-selectionist debate. Identifying specific regions of the human genome that show evidence of adaptive evolution helps us find functionally significant genes, including genes important for human health, such as those associated with diseases

. Many different studies have attempted to quantify the amount of adaptive evolution in the human genome, the vast majority using the comparative approaches outlined above. Although there are discrepancies between studies, generally there is relatively little evidence of adaptive evolution in protein coding DNA, with estimates of adaptive evolution often near 0% (see Table 1). The most obvious exception to this is the 35% estimate of α (Fay et al. 2001)

What is the null hypothesis that is tested by methods used to identify adaptive evolution?,neutral evolution,". The methods used to identify adaptive evolution are generally devised to test the null hypothesis of neutral evolution, which, if rejected, provides evidence of adaptive evolution. These tests can be broadly divided into two categories. Firstly, there are methods that use a comparative approach to search for evidence of function-altering mutations

. The other methods for detecting adaptive evolution use genome wide approaches, often to look for evidence of selective sweeps. Evidence of complete selective sweeps is shown by a decrease in genetic diversity, and can be inferred from comparing the patterns of the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS, i.e. the allele frequency distribution) obtained with the SFS expected under a neutral model (Willamson et al. 2007)

What is a recent method used to detect selection in non-coding sequences?,Examination of insertions and deletions (indels),". These genomic methods can also be applied to search for adaptive evolution in non-coding DNA, where putatively neutral sites are hard to identify (Ponting and Lunter 2006). Another recent method used to detect selection in non-coding sequences examines insertions and deletions (indels), rather than point mutations (Lunter et al. 2006), although the method has only been applied to examine patterns of negative selection

. As with the coding DNA however, the methods currently used are relatively weak. Ponting and Lunter (2006) speculate that underestimates may be even more severe in non-coding DNA, because non-coding DNA may undergo periods of functionality (and adaptive evolution), followed by periods of neutrality. If this is true, current methods for detecting adaptive evolution are inadequate to account for such patterns

. The other methods for detecting adaptive evolution use genome wide approaches, often to look for evidence of selective sweeps.

What percentage of adaptive evolution was estimated in protein coding DNA according to Fay et al. (2001)?,35%,". Many different studies have attempted to quantify the amount of adaptive evolution in the human genome, the vast majority using the comparative approaches outlined above. Although there are discrepancies between studies, generally there is relatively little evidence of adaptive evolution in protein coding DNA, with estimates of adaptive evolution often near 0% (see Table 1). The most obvious exception to this is the 35% estimate of α (Fay et al. 2001)

. Another recent study, which uses a relatively robust methodology, estimates α at 10–20% (Boyko et al. 2008). Clearly, the debate over the amount of adaptive evolution occurring in human coding DNA is not yet resolved. Even if low estimates of α are accurate, a small proportion of substitutions evolving adaptively can still equate to a considerable amount of coding DNA

. Andolfatto (2005) estimated that adaptive evolution has occurred in 60% of untranslated mature portions of mRNAs, and in 20% of intronic and intergenic regions.

How many more genes underwent positive selection in chimpanzee evolution compared to human?,More,". Many authors, whose studies have small estimates of the amount of adaptive evolution in coding DNA, nevertheless accept that there has been some adaptive evolution in this DNA, because these studies identify specific regions within the human genome which have been evolving adaptively (e.g. Bakewell et al.

What is estimated to be the effect of increasing population size on altering allele frequencies?,Random genetic drift becomes less powerful,". Generally, there does appear to be a positive correlation between (effective) population size of the species, and amount of adaptive evolution occurring in the coding DNA regions. This may be because random genetic drift becomes less powerful at altering allele frequencies, compared to natural selection, as population size increases. Estimates of the amount of adaptive evolution in non-coding DNA are generally very low, although fewer studies have been done on non-coding DNA

. Demographic changes are particularly problematic and may severely bias estimates of adaptive evolution. The human lineage has undergone both rapid population size contractions and expansions over its evolutionary history, and these events will change many of the signatures thought to be characteristic of adaptive evolution (Nielsen et al. 2007). Some genomic methods have been shown through simulations to be relatively robust to demographic changes (e.g. Willamson et al. 2007)

What is the estimated rate of adaptive evolution in the human genome according to Fay et al. (2001)?,One adaptive substitution per 200 years,". Therefore, the evidence obtained so far is inconclusive as to what extent different human populations have undergone different amounts of adaptive evolution. The rate of adaptive evolution in the human genome has often been assumed to be constant over time. For example, the 35% estimate for α calculated by Fay et al. (2001) led them to conclude that there was one adaptive substitution in the human lineage every 200 years since human divergence from old-world monkeys

. Many different studies have attempted to quantify the amount of adaptive evolution in the human genome, the vast majority using the comparative approaches outlined above.

What is the time period during which there has been a large acceleration in the amount of positive selection in the human lineage?,"40,000 years",". However, even if the original value of α is accurate for a particular time period, this extrapolation is still invalid. This is because there has been a large acceleration in the amount of positive selection in the human lineage over the last 40,000 years, in terms of the number of genes that have undergone adaptive evolution (Hawks et al. 2007)

. It has been argued that human evolution has accelerated since the development of agriculture 10,000 years ago and civilization some 5,000 years ago, resulting, it is claimed, in substantial genetic differences between different current human populations, and more recent research indicates that for some traits, the developments and innovations of human culture have driven a new form of selection that coexists with, and in some cases has largely replaced, natural selection

. Therefore, the fact that many estimates are at (or very near to) 0% does not rule out the occurrence of any adaptive evolution in the human genome, but simply shows that positive selection is not frequent enough to be detected by the tests.

"According to Hawks et al., what is a possible explanation for why the human population size has increased over time?","The dramatic expansion of the human population in the last 40,000 years",". 2007). This agrees with simple theoretical predictions, because the human population size has expanded dramatically in the last 40,000 years, and with more people, there should be more adaptive substitutions. Hawks et al

. Hawks et al. (2007) argue that demographic changes (particularly population expansion) may greatly facilitate adaptive evolution, an argument that somewhat corroborates the positive correlation inferred between population size and amount of adaptive evolution occurring mentioned previously. It has been suggested that cultural evolution may have replaced genetic evolution, and hence slowed the rate of adaptive evolution over the past 10,000 years

. In any case, the fact that the human gene pool has accumulated so many mutations over such a short period of time—in evolutionary terms—and that the human population has exploded in that time mean that humanity is more evolvable than ever before.

However, in the last half century, there has been considerable debate as to whether evolutionary changes at the molecular level are largely driven by natural selection or random genetic drift. Unsurprisingly, the forces which drive evolutionary changes in our own species’ lineage have been of particular interest

. It has been argued that human evolution has accelerated since the development of agriculture 10,000 years ago and civilization some 5,000 years ago, resulting, it is claimed, in substantial genetic differences between different current human populations, and more recent research indicates that for some traits, the developments and innovations of human culture have driven a new form of selection that coexists with, and in some cases has largely replaced, natural selection

. Hawks et al. (2007) argue that demographic changes (particularly population expansion) may greatly facilitate adaptive evolution, an argument that somewhat corroborates the positive correlation inferred between population size and amount of adaptive evolution occurring mentioned ","According to the context, it is human culture that has driven a new form of selection that coexists with and in some cases has largely replaced natural selection.",0.7,0.8,0.9,0.6,0.8,"The answer is factually correct, but it is not relevant to the question. The question asked about the replacement of genetic evolution, while the answer talks about cultural evolution."
"According to Hawks et al. (2007), what has cultural evolution increased?",communication and contact between different populations,". Hawks et al. (2007) argue that demographic changes (particularly population expansion) may greatly facilitate adaptive evolution, an argument that somewhat corroborates the positive correlation inferred between population size and amount of adaptive evolution occurring mentioned previously. It has been suggested that cultural evolution may have replaced genetic evolution, and hence slowed the rate of adaptive evolution over the past 10,000 years

. 2007). This agrees with simple theoretical predictions, because the human population size has expanded dramatically in the last 40,000 years, and with more people, there should be more adaptive substitutions. Hawks et al

. However, it is possible that cultural evolution could actually increase genetic adaptation. Cultural evolution has vastly increased communication and contact between different populations, and this provides much greater opportunities for genetic admixture between the different populations (Hawks et al. 2007)

Humans are unique in","According to the context, according to Hawks et al.

What is a possible reason why genetic adaptation may be reduced in modern humans?,Recent cultural phenomena such as modern medicine and smaller variation in family sizes,". 2007). However, recent cultural phenomena, such as modern medicine and the smaller variation in modern family sizes, may reduce genetic adaptation as natural selection is relaxed, overriding the increased potential for adaptation due to greater genetic admixture. Studies generally do not attempt to quantify the average strength of selection propagating advantageous mutations in the human genome

. For example, schizophrenia has been linked with increased creativity (Crespi et al. 2007), perhaps a useful trait for obtaining food or attracting mates in Palaeolithic times. Alternatively, the adaptive mutations may be the ones which reduce the chance of disease arising due to other mutations. However, this second explanation seems unlikely, because the mutation rate in the human genome is fairly low, so selection would be relatively weak

. Although selection pressure on some traits, such as resistance to smallpox, has decreased in the modern age, humans are still undergoing natural selection for many other traits. Some of these are due to specific environmental pressures, while others are related to lifestyle changes since the development of agriculture (10,000 years ago), urbanizat","According to the context, one possible reason for reduced genetic adaptation in modern humans is that ""recent cultural phenomena, such as modern medicine and the smaller variation in modern family sizes, may reduce genetic adaptation as natural selection is relaxed"".",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.0,"The answer is mostly correct, but it could be improved by providing additional context or by addressing the broader implications of cultural phenomena on genetic adaptation."
What has been attributed to different assumptions about the strength of selection in evolutionary models?,Discrepancies between estimates of adaptive evolution,". Many models make assumptions about how strong selection is, and some of the discrepancies between the estimates of the amounts of adaptive evolution occurring have been attributed to the use of such differing assumptions (Eyre-Walker 2006)

. The two alternative hypotheses are a relative absence of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN < dS; ω < 1), suggesting the effect on fitness ('fitness effect', or 'selection pressure') of such mutations is negative (purifying selection has operated over time); or a relative excess of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN > dS; ω > 1), indicating positive effect on fitness, i.e. diversifying selection (Yang and Bielawski 2000)

. The way to accurately estimate the average strength of positive selection acting on the human genome is by inferring the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new advantageous mutations in the human genome, but this DFE is difficult to infer because new advantageous mutations are very rare (Boyko et al. 2008). The DFE may be exponential shaped in an adapted population (Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2007)

(2005a)’s estimate that 9.8% of genes have undergone adaptive evolution also has a large margin of error ass","According to the context, discrepancies between estimates of adaptive evolution occurring have been attributed to different assumptions about the strength of selection in evolutionary models.",0.7,0.8,0.9,0.6,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the topic as referring to discrepancies between estimates of adaptive evolution occurring, but it does not provide a clear explanation of why this might be the case."
What can make it difficult to accurately estimate the average strength of positive selection acting on the human genome?,New advantageous mutations are very rare,". The way to accurately estimate the average strength of positive selection acting on the human genome is by inferring the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new advantageous mutations in the human genome, but this DFE is difficult to infer because new advantageous mutations are very rare (Boyko et al. 2008). The DFE may be exponential shaped in an adapted population (Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2007)

. Therefore, the fact that many estimates are at (or very near to) 0% does not rule out the occurrence of any adaptive evolution in the human genome, but simply shows that positive selection is not frequent enough to be detected by the tests. In fact, the most recent study mentioned states that confounding variables, such as demographic changes, mean that the true value of α may be as high as 40% (Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2009)

. However, more research is required to produce more accurate estimates of the average strength of positive selection in humans, which will in turn improve the estimates of the amount of adaptive evolution occurring in the human genome (Boyko et al. 2008).

The DFE may be exponential shaped in an adapted population (Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2007)

. However, even if the original value of α is accurate for a particular time period, this extrapolation is still invalid. This is because there has been a large acceleration in the amount of positive selection in the human lineage over the last 40,000 years, in terms of the number of genes that have undergone adaptive evolution (Hawks et al. 2007)

"What percentage of positively selected genes are associated with diseases, according to Bakewell et al. (2007)?",9.7%,". Table 2 gives selected examples of such genes for each gene type discussed, but provides nowhere near an exhaustive list of the human genes showing evidence of adaptive evolution. Below are listed some of the types of gene which show strong evidence of adaptive evolution in the human genome. Bakewell et al. (2007) found that a relatively large proportion (9.7%) of positively selected genes were associated with diseases. This may be because diseases can be adaptive in some contexts

. Nielsen et al. (2005a)’s estimate that 9.8% of genes have undergone adaptive evolution also has a large margin of error associated with it, and their estimate shrinks dramatically to 0.4% when they stipulate that the degree of certainty that there has been adaptive evolution must be 95% or more. This raises an important issue, which is that many of these tests for adaptive evolution are very weak

. Therefore, the fact that many estimates are at (or very near to) 0% does not rule out the occurrence of any adaptive evolution in the human genome, but simply shows that positive selection is not frequent enough to be detected by the tests.

What is the likely reason for the link between schizophrenia and increased creativity?,The adaptive mutations may have been useful traits for obtaining food or attracting mates in Palaeolithic times.,". (Some individuals with bipolar disorder are especially creative during their manic phases and the close relatives of people with schizophrenia have been found to be more likely to have creative professions

How many genes in the testes showed evidence of adaptive evolution according to Nielsen et al.'s study?,247,". 247 genes in the testes showed evidence of adaptive evolution in the study of Nielsen et al. (2005a). This could be partially due to sexual antagonism. Male–female competition could facilitate an arms race of adaptive evolution. However, in this situation you would expect to find evidence of adaptive evolution in the female sexual organs also, but there is less evidence of this. Sperm competition is another possible explanation

. Nielsen et al. (2005a)’s estimate that 9.8% of genes have undergone adaptive evolution also has a large margin of error associated with it, and their estimate shrinks dramatically to 0.4% when they stipulate that the degree of certainty that there has been adaptive evolution must be 95% or more. This raises an important issue, which is that many of these tests for adaptive evolution are very weak

. Other gene types showing considerable evidence of adaptive evolution (but generally less evidence than the types discussed) include: genes on the X chromosome, nervous system genes, genes involved in apoptosis, genes coding for skeletal traits, and possibly genes associated with speech (Nielsen et al. 2005a, Williamson et al. 2007, Voight et al. 2006, Krause","According to the context, 247 genes in the testes showed evidence of adaptive evolution in the study of Nielsen et al.

What is an example of how sperm can improve their chances of fertilizing the female egg?,"increasing their speed, stamina or response to chemoattractants",". Sperm competition is strong, and sperm can improve their chances of fertilising the female egg in a variety of ways, including increasing their speed, stamina or response to chemoattractants (Swanson and Vacquier 2002). Genes involved in detecting smell show strong evidence of adaptive evolution (Voight et al. 2006), probably due to the fact that the smells encountered by humans have changed recently in their evolutionary history (Williamson et al. 2007)

. However, under some circumstances, engaging in multiple sexual relationships can provide benefits to women as well, such as fertility insurance, trading up to better genes, reducing the risk of inbreeding, and insurance protection of her offspring. Due to male paternity uncertainty, sex differences have been found in the domains of sexual jealousy. Females generally react more adversely to emotional infidelity and males will react more to sexual infidelity

. These putative preferences are predicted to be especially apparent for short-term mating domains because a potential male mate would only be offering genes to a potential offspring. This hypothesis allows researchers to examine whether women select mates who have characte","According to the context, sperm can improve their chances of fertilising the female egg by:

What type of farming was historically important in European and American populations?,pastoral farming for milk,". Selection pressures were especially severe for populations affected by the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in Eurasia, and for sedentary farming populations since the Neolithic, or New Stone Age

. Evidence published in 2014 from genome analysis of ancient human remains suggests that the modern native populations of Europe largely descend from three distinct lineages: ""Western Hunter-Gatherers"", derivative of the Cro-Magnon population of Europe, Early European Farmers introduced to Europe from the Near East during the Neolithic Revolution and Ancient North Eurasians who expanded to Europe in the context of the Indo-European expansion

. Culture can profoundly influence gene frequencies in a population. One of the best known examples is the prevalence of the genotype for adult lactose absorption in human populations, such as Northern Europeans and some African societies, with a long history of raising cattle for milk. Until around 7,500 years ago, lactase production stopped shortly after weaning, and in societies which did not develop dairying, such as East Asians and Amerindians, this is still true today

What time period did humans leave Africa?,"approximately 50,000 years ago",". There is some evidence that modern humans left Africa at least 125,000 years ago using two different routes: through the Nile Valley, the Sinai Peninsula and the Levant (Qafzeh Cave: 120,000–100,000 years ago); and a second route through the present-day Bab-el-Mandeb Strait on the Red Sea (at that time, with a much lower sea level and narrower extension), crossing to the Arabian Peninsula and settling in places like the present-day United Arab Emirates (125,000 years ago) and Oman (106,000

Is microcephaly a condition related to brain size?,True,". The smaller birth canal became a limiting factor to brain size increases in early humans and prompted a shorter gestation period leading to the relative immaturity of human offspring, who are unable to walk much before 12 months and have greater neoteny, compared to other primates, who are mobile at a much earlier age

Jeremy De Silva and Julie Lesnik examined chimpanzee neonatal brain size to identify implications for brain growth in Homo erectus. This changed the understanding of differences and similarities of post-natal brain growth in humans and chimpanzees

. However more recently, there is more focus on absolute brain size as this scales with internal structures and functions, with the degree of structural complexity, and with the amount of white matter in the brain, all suggesting that absolute size is much better predictor of brain function.

What is mentioned as potentially hindering the accurate detection of adaptive evolution?,Demographic changes and biased gene conversion,". 2007, Voight et al. 2006, Krause et al. 2007). As noted previously, many of the tests used to detect adaptive evolution have very large degrees of uncertainty surrounding their estimates. While there are many different modifications applied to individual tests to overcome the associated problems, two types of confounding variables are particularly important in hindering the accurate detection of adaptive evolution: demographic changes and biased gene conversion

. The other methods for detecting adaptive evolution use genome wide approaches, often to look for evidence of selective sweeps. Evidence of complete selective sweeps is shown by a decrease in genetic diversity, and can be inferred from comparing the patterns of the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS, i.e. the allele frequency distribution) obtained with the SFS expected under a neutral model (Willamson et al. 2007)

What is the expected outcome when a DNA mismatch is repaired in meiotic recombination?,"The repair mechanism leads to changing allele frequencies, resulting in a signature of non-neutral evolution",". Meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes that are heterozygous at a particular locus can produce a DNA mismatch. DNA repair mechanisms are biased towards repairing a mismatch to the CG base pair. This will lead allele frequencies to change, leaving a signature of non-neutral evolution (Galtier et al. 2001)

. Secondly, HARs tend to be present in regions with high recombination rates (Pollard et al. 2006). In fact, BGC could lead to HARs containing a high frequency of deleterious mutations (Galtier and Duret 2007). However, it is unlikely that HARs are generally maladaptive, because DNA repair mechanisms themselves would be subject to strong selection if they propagated deleterious mutations

. Another recent study, which uses a relatively robust methodology, estimates α at 10–20% (Boyko et al. 2008). Clearly, the debate over the amount of adaptive evolution occurring in human coding DNA is not yet resolved. Even if low estimates of α are accurate, a small proportion of substitutions evolving adaptively can still equate to a considerable amount of coding DNA

. As with the coding DNA however, the methods currently used are relatively weak.

"Initially, what was postulated about the role of BGC in the human genome?",That it could have been adaptive,". 2001). The excess of AT to GC mutations in human genomic regions with high substitution rates (human accelerated regions, HARs) implies that BGC has occurred frequently in the human genome (Pollard et al. 2006, Galtier and Duret 2007). Initially, it was postulated that BGC could have been adaptive (Galtier et al. 2001), but more recent observations have made this seem unlikely. Firstly, some HARs show no substantial signs of selective sweeps around them

. However, this would still leave unanswered what function all this non-coding DNA performs, as the regulatory activity observed thus far is in just a tiny proportion of the total amount of non-coding DNA. Ultimately, significantly more evidence needs to be gathered to substantiate this viewpoint.

Hamilton's (1964) papers on inclusive fitness and Robert Trivers's (1972) theories on reciprocity and parental investment helped to establish evolutionary thinking in psychology and the other social sciences

. Dual inheritance theory (DIT), developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has a slightly different perspective by trying to explain how human behavior is a product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: genetic evolution and cultural evolution. DIT is seen by some as a ""middle-ground"" between views that emphasize human universals versus those that emphasize cultural variation

. Wilson in 1975 as ""the systematic study of the biological basis of all social behavior"" and in 1978 as ""the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization."" Secondly, there was behavioral ecology which placed less emphasis on social behavior; it focused on the ec","According to the context, two types of evolutionary theories were developed during this period:

1. Inclusive fitness (developed by W.D. Hamilton in 1964) and reciprocity/parental investment theories (developed by Robert Trivers in 1972), which helped establish evolutionary thinking in psychology and social sciences.
2. Dual inheritance theory (DIT), developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which explains how human behavior is a product of two interacting evolutionary processes: genetic evolution and cultural evolution.

So, there were two types of evolutionary theories developed during this period: inclusive fitness/reciprocity/parental investment theories and dual inheritance theory.",0.7,0.8,0.9,0.6,0.8,"The LLM correctly identifies the 1960s as a period when evolutionary theories were developed in the field of evolutionary biology, but it provides a less specific description of the specific theories that emerged during that period."
"According to the dual inheritance theory, does cultural change occur independently of gene changes?",False,". Genes and culture continually interact in a feedback loop: changes in genes can lead to changes in culture which can then influence genetic selection, and vice versa. One of the theory's central claims is that culture evolves partly through a Darwinian selection process, which dual inheritance theorists often describe by analogy to genetic evolution

. (format of table and some data displayed as in Table 1 of Eyre-Walker (2006)) --- # Dual inheritance theory Dual inheritance theory (DIT), also known as gene–culture coevolution or biocultural evolution, was developed in the 1960s through early 1980s to explain how human behavior is a product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: genetic evolution and cultural evolution

The text states that ""genes and culture continually interact in a feedback loop: changes in genes can lead to changes in culture which can then influence genetic selection, and vice versa."" This suggests that cultural evolution is influenced by genetic evolution and vice versa, implying that cultural change cannot occur without some corresponding change in genes.",0.2,0.3,0.4,0.6,0.0,The LLM's answer fails to accurately identify the relationship between genes and culture in the context. It presents a false dichotomy by stating that cultural change occurs independently of gene changes.
What is the definition of 'Culture' used in this context?,socially learned behavior,". A definition that sums up what is meant by ""culture"" in DIT is: Culture is socially learned information stored in individuals' brains that is capable of affecting behavior. This view of culture emphasizes population thinking by focusing on the process by which culture is generated and maintained. It also views culture as a dynamic property of individuals, as opposed to a view of culture as a superorganic entity to which individuals must conform

. 'Culture', in this context, is defined as 'socially learned behavior', and 'social learning' is defined as copying behaviors observed in others or acquiring behaviors through being taught by others. Most of the modelling done in the field relies on the first dynamic (copying), though it can be extended to teaching

. Two major topics of study in both sociology and cultural anthropology are human cultures and cultural variation. However, Dual Inheritance theorists charge that both disciplines too often treat culture as a static superorganic entity that dictates human behavior. Cultures are defined by a suite of common traits shared by a large group of people. DIT theorists argue that this doesn't sufficiently explain variation in cultura","According to the given context, ""Culture"" is defined as ""socially learned information stored in individuals' brains that is capable of affecting behavior"".",1.0,1.0,0.95,0.85,0.9,The LLM correctly identifies that the definition of 'Culture' is about socially learned information stored in individuals' brains that is capable of affecting behavior.
What is an example of a potential bias in social learning?,success bias,". Social learning, at its simplest, involves blind copying of behaviors from a model (someone observed behaving), though it is also understood to have many potential biases, including success bias (copying from those who are perceived to be better off), status bias (copying from those with higher status), homophily (copying from those most like ourselves), conformist bias (disproportionately picking up behaviors that more people are performing), etc

. This book presents the now-standard mathematical models of the evolution of social learning under different environmental conditions, the population effects of social learning, various forces of selection on cultural learning rules, different forms of biased transmission and their population-level effects, and conflicts between cultural and genetic evolution. The book's conclusion also outlined areas for future research that are still relevant today

."" Context biases result from individuals using clues about the social structure of their population to determine what cultural variants to adopt. This determination is made without reference to the content of the variant. There are two major categories of context biases: model-based bia","According to the provided context, an example of a potential bias in social learning is ""success bias"", which involves copying behaviors from those who are perceived to be better off.",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.7,0.9,The LLM correctly identifies the concept of success bias as an example of a bias in social learning. It also correctly identifies the context of the phrase as being about social learning.
What type of evolutionary structure is established when there are different rates of survival for different socially learned cultural variants?,Cultural evolution,". Understanding social learning is a system of pattern replication, and understanding that there are different rates of survival for different socially learned cultural variants, this sets up, by definition, an evolutionary structure: cultural evolution. Because genetic evolution is relatively well understood, most of DIT examines cultural evolution and the interactions between cultural evolution and genetic evolution

. In DIT, the evolution and maintenance of cultures is described by five major mechanisms: natural selection of cultural variants, random variation, cultural drift, guided variation and transmission bias. Differences between cultural phenomena result in differential rates of their spread; similarly, cultural differences among individuals can lead to differential survival and reproduction rates of individuals

. Analysis of small groups in New Guinea imply that cultural group selection might be a good explanation for slowly changing aspects of social structure, but not for rapidly changing fads. The ability of cultural evolution to maintain intergroup diversity is what allows for the study of cultural phylogenetics

. This book presents the now-standard mathematical m","According to the context, an evolutionary structure that is set up by definition when there are different rates of survival for different socially learned cultural variants is a ""cultural evolution"".",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.0,"The LLM's answer is correct, but it does not accurately capture the complexity and nuance of the term 'cultural evolution'."
What theory holds that genetic and cultural evolution interacted in the evolution of Homo sapiens?,DIT,". DIT holds that genetic and cultural evolution interacted in the evolution of Homo sapiens. DIT recognizes that the natural selection of genotypes is an important component of the evolution of human behavior and that cultural traits can be constrained by genetic imperatives. However, DIT also recognizes that genetic evolution has endowed the human species with a parallel evolutionary process of cultural evolution

. However, it is possible that cultural evolution could actually increase genetic adaptation. Cultural evolution has vastly increased communication and contact between different populations, and this provides much greater opportunities for genetic admixture between the different populations (Hawks et al. 2007)

. Genes and culture continually interact in a feedback loop: changes in genes can lead to changes in culture which can then influence genetic selection, and vice versa. One of the theory's central claims is that culture evolves partly through a Darwinian selection process, which dual inheritance theorists often describe by analogy to genetic evolution

What is one of the main claims made by DIT?,The human capacity to store and transmit culture arose from genetically evolved psychological mechanisms.,". Although findings from traditional ethnologic studies have been used to buttress DIT arguments, thus far there have been little ethnographic fieldwork designed to explicitly test these hypotheses. Herb Gintis has named DIT one of the two major conceptual theories with potential for unifying the behavioral sciences, including economics, biology, anthropology, sociology, psychology and political science

. Dual inheritance theory (DIT), developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has a slightly different perspective by trying to explain how human behavior is a product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: genetic evolution and cultural evolution. DIT is seen by some as a ""middle-ground"" between views that emphasize human universals versus those that emphasize cultural variation

. One difference is that memetics' focus is on the selection potential of discrete replicators (memes), where DIT allows for transmission of both non-replicators and non-discrete cultural variants. DIT does not assume that replicators are necessary for cumulative adaptive evolution. DIT also more strongly emphasizes the role of genetic inheritance in shaping the capacity for cultural evo","According to the context, one of the main claims made by Dual Inheritance Theory (DIT) is that human behavior is a product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: genetic evolution and cultural evolution.",0.7,0.8,0.8,0.6,0.0,"The answer provides a factual description of one of the main claims made by DIT, but it does not provide a clear and concise explanation of the theory itself."
What is an example of a cultural trait that has led to genetic selection?,the cultural adoptions of agriculture and dairying,". Cultural traits are transmitted differently from genetic traits and, therefore, result in different population-level effects on behavioral variation. Cultural traits alter the social and physical environments under which genetic selection operates. For example, the cultural adoptions of agriculture and dairying have, in humans, caused genetic selection for the traits to digest starch and lactose, respectively

. As another example, it is likely that once culture became adaptive, genetic selection caused a refinement of the cognitive architecture that stores and transmits cultural information. This refinement may have further influenced the way culture is stored and the biases that govern its transmission. DIT also predicts that, under certain situations, cultural evolution may select for traits that are genetically maladaptive

. Although group selection is commonly thought to be nonexistent or unimportant in genetic evolution, DIT predicts that, due to the nature of cultural inheritance, it may be an important force in cultural evolution. Group selection occurs in cultural evolution because conformist biases make it difficult for novel cultural traits to spread through a populat","According to the context, an example of a cultural trait that has led to genetic selection is the adoption of agriculture, which caused genetic selection for the ability to digest starch.",0.5,0.6,0.7,0.3,0.0,"The LLM's answer is partially correct. It correctly identifies the cultural trait as the adoption of agriculture, but it provides an incorrect example of genetic selection (e.g., domestication of animals) as a counter-example."
Does DIT predict that genetic selection can cause a refinement of the cognitive architecture that stores and transmits cultural information?,Yes,". As another example, it is likely that once culture became adaptive, genetic selection caused a refinement of the cognitive architecture that stores and transmits cultural information.

This implies that at some point during the evolution of the human species a type of social learning leading to cumulative cultural evolution was evolutionarily advantageous. Social learning processes give rise to cultu","According to the context, YES, DIT predicts that once culture became adaptive, genetic selection caused a refinement of the cognitive architecture that stores and transmits cultural information.",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.7,0.0,"The context mentions the prediction of genetic refinement based on cultural adaptation, but it does not provide specific evidence or analysis to support this claim."
What is an example of demographic transition described in the context?,the fall of birth rates within industrialized societies,". An example of this is the demographic transition, which describes the fall of birth rates within industrialized societies. Dual inheritance theorists hypothesize that the demographic transition may be a result of a prestige bias, where individuals that forgo reproduction to gain more influence in industrial societies are more likely to be chosen as cultural models. People have defined the word ""culture"" to describe a large set of different phenomena

.g. Willamson et al. 2007). However, no tests are completely robust to demographic changes, and new genetic phenomena linked to demographic changes have recently been discovered. This includes the concept of “surfing mutations”, where new mutations can be propagated with a population expansion (Klopfstein et al. 2006). A phenomenon which could severely alter the way we look for signatures of adaptive evolution is biased gene conversion (BGC) (Galtier and Duret 2007)

. Demographic changes are particularly problematic and may severely bias estimates of adaptive evolution. The human lineage has undergone both rapid population size contractions and expansions over its evolutionary history, and these events will change many of the signat",The example of demographic transition mentioned in the context is the fall of birth rates within industrialized societies.,1.0,1.0,0.8,0.6,1.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the demographic transition as an example of this concept, but it does not provide an accurate description of the concept itself."

Evolutionary psychologists study the evolved architecture of the human mind. They see it as composed of many different programs th","According to the context, ""culture"" in DIT refers to: ""socially learned information stored in individuals' brains that is capable of affecting behavior.""",1.0,1.0,0.95,0.9,0.98,The LLM correctly identifies the definition of 'culture' in the context as the socially learned information stored in individuals' brains that is capable of affecting behavior.
What is one way genes affect cultural evolution?,via psychological predispositions on cultural learning,". This view's main advantage is that it connects individual-level processes to population-level outcomes. Genes affect cultural evolution via psychological predispositions on cultural learning. Genes encode much of the information needed to form the human brain. Genes constrain the brain's structure and, hence, the ability of the brain to acquire and store culture. Genes may also endow individuals with certain types of transmission bias (described below)

. However, it is possible that cultural evolution could actually increase genetic adaptation. Cultural evolution has vastly increased communication and contact between different populations, and this provides much greater opportunities for genetic admixture between the different populations (Hawks et al. 2007)

It should have emphasized the role of psychological predispositions in shaping cultural evolution, rather than solely focusing on genes."
In which human populations does lactase production typically stop shortly after weaning?,East Asians and Amerindians,". Culture can profoundly influence gene frequencies in a population. One of the best known examples is the prevalence of the genotype for adult lactose absorption in human populations, such as Northern Europeans and some African societies, with a long history of raising cattle for milk. Until around 7,500 years ago, lactase production stopped shortly after weaning, and in societies which did not develop dairying, such as East Asians and Amerindians, this is still true today

. Thousands of years later, a genetic mutation enabled people living in Europe at the time to continue producing lactase, an enzyme that digests lactose, throughout their lives, allowing them to drink milk after weaning and survive bad harvests. Today, lactase persistence can be found in 90% or more of the populations in Northwestern and Northern Central Europe, and in pockets of Western and Southeastern Africa, Saudi Arabia, and South Asia

. In the twenty-first century, about 35% of the human population is capable of digesting lactose after the age of seven or eight. Before this mutation, dairy farming was already widespread in Europe. A Finnish research team reported that the European mutation that allows fo","According to the context, lactase production typically stops shortly after weaning in societies which did not develop dairying, such as East Asians and Amerindians. This is still true today.",1.0,1.0,0.95,0.8,1.0,The answer is consistent with the context and provides a reasonable description of the prevalence of lactase production after weaning in societies which did not develop dairying.
What is the estimated selection coefficient for lactase persistence in a Scandinavian population?,0.09-0.19,". In areas with lactase persistence, it is believed that by domesticating animals, a source of milk became available while an adult and thus strong selection for lactase persistence could occur; in a Scandinavian population, the estimated selection coefficient was 0.09-0.19. This implies that the cultural practice of raising cattle first for meat and later for milk led to selection for genetic traits for lactose digestion

. In the twenty-first century, about 35% of the human population is capable of digesting lactose after the age of seven or eight. Before this mutation, dairy farming was already widespread in Europe. A Finnish research team reported that the European mutation that allows for lactase persistence is not found among the milk-drinking and dairy-farming Africans, however

. Sarah Tishkoff and her students confirmed this by analyzing DNA samples from Tanzania, Kenya, and Sudan, where lactase persistence evolved independently. The uniformity of the mutations surrounding the lactase gene suggests that lactase persistence spread rapidly throughout this part of Africa. According to Tishkoff's data, this mutation first appeared between 3,000 and 7,000 years ago

It is not","According to the context, the estimated selection coefficient for lactase persistence in a Scandinavian population was 0.09-0.19.",0.75,0.8,0.9,0.9,0.0,"The answer is mostly correct, but it could be improved by providing a specific estimate or reference to support the value of 0.09-0.19."
What factor has driven changes to the human digestive systems making many digestive organs smaller than expected for primates?,Culture,". Recently, analysis of natural selection on the human genome suggests that civilization has accelerated genetic change in humans over the past 10,000 years. Culture has driven changes to the human digestive systems making many digestive organs, such as teeth or stomach, smaller than expected for primates of a similar size, and has been attributed to one of the reasons why humans have such large brains compared to other great apes. This is due to food processing

. A number of other changes have also characterized the evolution of humans, among them an increased reliance on vision rather than smell (highly reduced olfactory bulb); a longer juvenile developmental period and higher infant dependency; a smaller gut and small, misaligned teeth; faster basal metabolism; loss of body hair; an increase in eccrine sweat gland density that is ten times higher than any other catarrhinian primates, yet humans use 30% to 50% less water per day compared to chimps and

. The smaller birth canal became a limiting factor to brain size increases in early humans and prompted a shorter gestation period leading to the relative immaturity of human offspring, who are unable to walk much before 12 months","According to the context, culture has driven changes to the human digestive systems making many digestive organs, such as teeth or stomach, smaller than expected for primates of a similar size.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies that culture plays a role in driving changes to the human digestive systems, but the score could be higher due to the lack of specific details about how culture affects the digestive system."
What is one way that cooking affects food?,partially breaks down food making it more easily digestible,". This is argued to explain why human brains can be much larger than other apes, since humans are the only ape to engage in food processing. The cooking of food has influenced genes to the extent that, research suggests, humans cannot live without cooking. A study on 513 individuals consuming long-term raw diets found that as the percentage of their diet which was made up of raw food and/or the length they had been on a diet of raw food increased, their BMI decreased

. This is due to food processing. Early examples of food processing include pounding, marinating and most notably cooking. Pounding meat breaks down the muscle fibres, hence taking away some of the job from the mouth, teeth and jaw. Marinating emulates the action of the stomach with high acid levels. Cooking partially breaks down food making it more easily digestible

. Food enters the body effectively partly digested, and as such food processing reduces the work that the digestive system has to do.

What percentage of the day do American girls and boys spend on average chewing?,7 to 8 percent,". Humans living on cooked diets spend only a fraction of their day chewing compared to other extant primates living on raw diets. American girls and boys spent on average 7 to 8 percent of their day chewing respectively (1.68 to 1.92 hours per day), compared to chimpanzees, who spend more than 6 hours a day chewing. This frees up time which can be used for hunting

. However, this is contested, with alternative modelling showing enough calories could be obtained within 5–6 hours per day. Some scientists and anthropologists point to evidence that brain size in the Homo lineage started to increase well before the advent of cooking due to increased consumption of meat and that basic food processing (slicing) accounts for the size reduction in organs related to chewing. Cornélio et al

. Paleontology has yet to explain the expansion of this organ over millions of years despite being extremely demanding in terms of energy consumption.

What percentage increase in digestibility of carbohydrates does cooking provide compared to not cooking?,30%,". This frees up time which can be used for hunting. A raw diet means hunting is constrained since time spent hunting is time not spent eating and chewing plant material, but cooking reduces the time required to get the day's energy requirements, allowing for more subsistence activities. Digestibility of cooked carbohydrates is approximately on average 30% higher than digestibility of non-cooked carbohydrates

What is a major constraint in the selection for larger brains?,Calorie intake,". This increased energy intake, more free time and savings made on tissue used in the digestive system allowed for the selection of genes for larger brain size. Despite its benefits, brain tissue requires a large amount of calories, hence a main constraint in selection for larger brains is calorie intake. A greater calorie intake can support greater quantities of brain tissue

. However more recently, there is more focus on absolute brain size as this scales with internal structures and functions, with the degree of structural complexity, and with the amount of white matter in the brain, all suggesting that absolute size is much better predictor of brain function. Finally, a fourth argument is that of natural selection (Darwinism) versus developmental constraints (concerted evolution)

. Miller argues that the rapid increases in brain size would have occurred by a positive feedback loop resulting in a Fisherian runaway selection for larger brains. Tor Nørretranders, in The Generous Man conjectures how intelligence, musicality, artistic and social skills, and language might have evolved as an example of the handicap principle, analogously with the peacock's tail, the standard exampl","According to the context, a major constraint in the selection for larger brains is calorie intake.

How many hours of feeding does a raw diet require according to the given context?,More than nine hours,". This is despite access to many non-thermal processing, like grinding, pounding or heating to 48 °C. (118 °F). With approximately 86 billion neurons in the human brain and 60–70 kg body mass, an exclusively raw diet close to that of what extant primates have would be not viable as, when modelled, it is argued that it would require an infeasible level of more than nine hours of feeding every day

When did brain size in the Homo lineage start to increase?,Well before the advent of cooking,". During human evolution, on at least two occasions, hominid brain size increased rapidly over a short period of time followed by a period of stasis. The first period of brain expansion occurred 2.5 million years ago, when Homo habilis first began using stone tools. The second period occurred 500,000 years ago, with the emergence of archaic Homo sapiens

. Increasing brain size has also been significant in human evolution. It began to increase approximately 2.4 million years ago, but modern levels of brain size were not attained until after 500,000 years ago. Zoological analyses have shown that the size of human brains is significantly larger than what anatomists would expect for their size. The human brain is three to four times larger than its closest relative, which is the chimpanzee

When did Cornélio et al. argue that cooking came as a consequence of complex cognition?,much later,". Cornélio et al. argues that improving cooperative abilities and a varying of diet to more meat and seeds improved foraging and hunting efficiency. It is this that allowed for the brain expansion, independent of cooking which they argue came much later, a consequence from the complex cognition that developed. Yet this is still an example of a cultural shift in diet and the resulting genetic evolution. Further criticism comes from the controversy of the archaeological evidence available

. Critics object that this view is reductionist and that cognitive specialisation only comes about through the interaction of humans with their real environment, rather than the environment of distant ancestors. Interdisciplinary approaches are increasingly striving to mediate between these opposing points of view and to highlight that biological and cultural causes need not be antithetical in explaining human behaviour and even complex cultural achievements

. Michael Tomasello argues that cumulative cultural evolution results from a ratchet effect that began when humans developed the cognitive architecture to understand others as mental agents. Furthermore, Tomasello proposed in the 80s that ther","According to the context, Cornélio et al. argued that cooking came much later, as a consequence of complex cognition that developed after improving cooperative abilities and varying diet to more meat and seeds improved foraging and hunting efficiency.",0.5,0.8,0.7,0.4,0.0,"The answer is somewhat relevant, but it is not clear what the context is referring to and how it relates to the argument."
When did the origin of Homo erectus occur?,1.8 million years ago,".7–11 million years ago during the Late Miocene. H. erectus appeared about 2 million years ago and spread throughout Africa (debatably as another species called Homo ergaster) and Eurasia in several migrations. The species was adaptive and successful, and persisted for more than a million years before gradually diverging into new species around 500,000 years ago.[b] Anatomically modern humans (H. sapiens) emerged close to 300,000 to 200,000 years ago in Africa, and H

. Homo habilis, although significantly different of anatomy and physiology, is thought to be the ancestor of Homo ergaster, or African Homo erectus; but it is also known to have coexisted with H. erectus for almost half a million years (until about 1.5 Ma). From its earliest appearance at about 1.9 Ma, H. erectus is distributed in East Africa and Southwest Asia (Homo georgicus). H. erectus is the first known species to develop control of fire, by about 1.5 Ma. H

What does Wrangham argue indicates the control of fire?,The loss of the ability to climb,". Some claim there is a lack of evidence of fire control when brain sizes first started expanding. Wrangham argues that anatomical evidence around the time of the origin of Homo erectus (1.8 million years ago), indicates that the control of fire and hence cooking occurred. At this time, the largest reductions in tooth size in the entirety of human evolution occurred, indicating that softer foods became prevalent in the diet

. Also at this time was a narrowing of the pelvis indicating a smaller gut and also there is evidence that there was a loss of the ability to climb which Wrangham argues indicates the control of fire, since sleeping on the ground needs fire to ward off predators

. Richard Wrangham notes that Homo seems to have been ground dwelling, with reduced intestinal length, smaller dentition, and ""brains [swollen] to their current, horrendously fuel-inefficient size"", and hypothesizes that control of fire and cooking, which released increased nutritional value, was the key adaptation that separated Homo from tree-sleeping Australopithecines. These are proposed as species intermediate between H. erectus and H. heidelbergensis. H

3. A narrowing of the pelvis, indicating a smaller gut.

. During human evolution, on at least two occasions, hominid brain size increased rapidly over a short period of time followed by a period of stasis. The first period of brain expansion occurred 2.5 million years ago, when Homo habilis first began using stone tools. The second period occurred 500,000 years ago, with the emergence of archaic Homo sapiens

. The proposed increases in brain size from food processing will have led to a greater mental capacity for further cultural innovation in food processing which will have increased digestive efficiency further providing more energy for further gains in brain size. This positive feedback loop is argued to have led to the rapid brain size increases seen in the Homo lineage

What are the five major mechanisms by which cultures evolve and maintain themselves in DIT?,"natural selection of cultural variants, random variation, cultural drift, guided variation and transmission bias",". In DIT, the evolution and maintenance of cultures is described by five major mechanisms: natural selection of cultural variants, random variation, cultural drift, guided variation and transmission bias. Differences between cultural phenomena result in differential rates of their spread; similarly, cultural differences among individuals can lead to differential survival and reproduction rates of individuals

. DIT makes three main claims: The human capacity to store and transmit culture arose from genetically evolved psychological mechanisms. This implies that at some point during the evolution of the human species a type of social learning leading to cumulative cultural evolution was evolutionarily advantageous. Social learning processes give rise to cultural evolution

. By contrast, DIT models human culture at the individual level and views culture as the result of a dynamic evolutionary process at the population level. Evolutionary psychologists study the evolved architecture of the human mind. They see it as composed of many different programs that process information, each with assumptions and procedures that were specialized by natural selection to solve a different adaptiv","According to the provided context, the five major mechanisms by which cultures evolve and maintain themselves in DIT are:

1. Natural selection of cultural variants
2. Random variation
3. Cultural drift
4. Guided variation
5. Transmission bias",0.7,0.8,0.9,0.5,0.8,"The LLM's answer provides some of the major mechanisms, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the nuances and complexities of each mechanism. It also makes several factual errors."
What is one analogy between cultural evolution and biological evolution?,"Random variation arises from errors in the learning, display or recall of cultural information",". DIT holds that genetic and cultural evolution interacted in the evolution of Homo sapiens. DIT recognizes that the natural selection of genotypes is an important component of the evolution of human behavior and that cultural traits can be constrained by genetic imperatives. However, DIT also recognizes that genetic evolution has endowed the human species with a parallel evolutionary process of cultural evolution

. Hawks et al. (2007) argue that demographic changes (particularly population expansion) may greatly facilitate adaptive evolution, an argument that somewhat corroborates the positive correlation inferred between population size and amount of adaptive evolution occurring mentioned previously. It has been suggested that cultural evolution may have replaced genetic evolution, and hence slowed the rate of adaptive evolution over the past 10,000 years

. They also argue that some of the phenomena DIT models attribute to cultural evolution are cases of ""evoked culture""—situations in which different evolved programs are activated in different places, in response to cues in the environment. Sociobiologists try to understand how maximizing genetic fitness, in either the modern e","Based on the context, one analogy between cultural evolution and biological evolution is that both involve a ""parallel evolutionary process"". This suggests that cultural evolution has its own mechanisms of variation, selection, and transmission, similar to biological evolution.",0.8,0.7,0.6,0.5,0.8,"The analogy is somewhat relevant, but it is not as strong as it could be. It does not capture all the nuances of both cultural and biological evolution."
What is the primary factor contributing to the disappearance of cultural variants in small populations?,Sampling error,". In cultural drift, the frequency of cultural traits in a population may be subject to random fluctuations due to chance variations in which traits are observed and transmitted (sometimes called ""sampling error""). These fluctuations might cause cultural variants to disappear from a population. This effect should be especially strong in small populations

. Analysis of small groups in New Guinea imply that cultural group selection might be a good explanation for slowly changing aspects of social structure, but not for rapidly changing fads. The ability of cultural evolution to maintain intergroup diversity is what allows for the study of cultural phylogenetics

. It has been proposed that human culture acts as a selective force in human evolution and has accelerated it; however, this is disputed. With a sufficiently large data set and modern research methods, scientists can study the changes in the frequency of an allele occurring in a tiny subset of the population over a single lifetime, the shortest meaningful time scale in evolution

. In DIT, the evolution and maintenance of cultures is described by five major mechanisms: natural selection of cultural variants, random variation","According to the context, the primary factor contributing to the disappearance of cultural variants in small populations is ""sampling error"", which refers to random fluctuations due to chance variations in which traits are observed and transmitted.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies sampling error as a factor contributing to the disappearance of cultural variants. However, it could provide more specific examples or acknowledge that sampling error is not the sole factor responsible for cultural variation in small populations."
"What type of cultural process is suggested to explain changes in American baby names, archaeological pottery, technology patent applications, and the songs of song birds?",Cultural drift,". A model by Hahn and Bentley shows that cultural drift gives a reasonably good approximation to changes in the popularity of American baby names. Drift processes have also been suggested to explain changes in archaeological pottery and technology patent applications. Changes in the songs of song birds are also thought to arise from drift processes, where distinct dialects in different groups occur due to errors in songbird singing and acquisition by successive generations

. Transcending the continuity-versus-discontinuity divide, some scholars view the emergence of language as the consequence of some kind of social transformation that, by generating unprecedented levels of public trust, liberated a genetic potential for linguistic creativity that had previously lain dormant. ""Ritual/speech coevolution theory"" exemplifies this approach

. Another approach, this time archaeological, involves invoking symbolic behavior (such as repeated ritual activity) that may leave an archaeological trace—such as mining and modifying ochre pigments for body-painting—while developing theoretical arguments to justify inferences from symbolism in general to language in particular

. For researchers,","According to the context, the type of cultural process suggested to explain changes in American baby names, archaeological pottery, technology patent applications, and the songs of song birds is ""cultural drift"".",1.0,1.0,0.95,0.8,1.0,"According to the context, the type of cultural process suggested to explain changes in American baby names, archaeological pottery, technology patent applications, and the songs of song birds is 'cultural drift'."
What is one way cultural traits may be gained in a population?,Through the process of individual learning,". Cultural drift is also observed in an early computer model of cultural evolution. Cultural traits may be gained in a population through the process of individual learning. Once an individual learns a novel trait, it can be transmitted to other members of the population. The process of guided variation depends on an adaptive standard that determines what cultural variants are learned

. Cultural traits are transmitted differently from genetic traits and, therefore, result in different population-level effects on behavioral variation. Cultural traits alter the social and physical environments under which genetic selection operates. For example, the cultural adoptions of agriculture and dairying have, in humans, caused genetic selection for the traits to digest starch and lactose, respectively

. In cultural drift, the frequency of cultural traits in a population may be subject to random fluctuations due to chance variations in which traits are observed and transmitted (sometimes called ""sampling error""). These fluctuations might cause cultural variants to disappear from a population. This effect should be especially strong in small populations

. However, it is possible that cultur",One way cultural traits may be gained in a population through the process of individual learning.,0.8,0.7,0.9,0.5,0.9,"The LLM correctly states that cultural traits may be gained in a population through the process of individual learning, but it does not provide specific details about the process or provide evidence to support the claim."
Who defined and analytically modeled transmission biases in cultural transmission?,Boyd and Richerson,". Understanding the different ways that culture traits can be transmitted between individuals has been an important part of DIT research since the 1970s. Transmission biases occur when some cultural variants are favored over others during the process of cultural transmission. Boyd and Richerson (1985) defined and analytically modeled a number of possible transmission biases. The list of biases has been refined over the years, especially by Henrich and McElreath

. Some critics felt that their models depended too heavily on genetic mechanisms at the expense of cultural mechanisms. Controversy surrounding Wilson's sociobiological theories may also have decreased the lasting effect of this book. The second 1981 book was Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman's Cultural Transmission and Evolution: A Quantitative Approach. Borrowing heavily from population genetics and epidemiology, this book built a mathematical theory concerning the spread of cultural traits

What type of environment favors the evolution of social learning?,Environments that change with a frequency that genetic inheritance cannot track but not fast enough that individual learning is more efficient.,". This book presents the now-standard mathematical models of the evolution of social learning under different environmental conditions, the population effects of social learning, various forces of selection on cultural learning rules, different forms of biased transmission and their population-level effects, and conflicts between cultural and genetic evolution. The book's conclusion also outlined areas for future research that are still relevant today

. Analytic models show that social learning becomes evolutionarily beneficial when the environment changes with enough frequency that genetic inheritance can not track the changes, but not fast enough that individual learning is more efficient. For environments that have very little variability, social learning is not needed since genes can adapt fast enough to the changes that occur, and innate behaviour is able to deal with the constant environment

. Understanding social learning is a system of pattern replication, and understanding that there are different rates of survival for different socially learned cultural variants, this sets up, by definition, an evolutionary structure: cultural evolution. Because genetic evolution is rel","According to the context, environments that have some variability, but not so fast that individual learning is more efficient, favor the evolution of social learning.",0.5,0.7,0.8,0.2,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the key factor that promotes the evolution of social learning as environmental variability, but it provides a somewhat inaccurate description of the specific conditions. It also could have utilized the context to provide a more precise answer."
In what type of environmental settings is cultural learning considered most useful?,Moderately changing environments,". In fast changing environments cultural learning would not be useful because what the previous generation knew is now outdated and will provide no benefit in the changed environment, and hence individual learning is more beneficial. It is only in the moderately changing environment where cultural learning becomes useful since each generation shares a mostly similar environment but genes have insufficient time to change to changes in the environment

. 'Culture', in this context, is defined as 'socially learned behavior', and 'social learning' is defined as copying behaviors observed in others or acquiring behaviors through being taught by others. Most of the modelling done in the field relies on the first dynamic (copying), though it can be extended to teaching

. While other species have social learning, and thus some level of culture, only humans, some birds and chimpanzees are known to have cumulative culture.

Although group selection is commonly thought to be nonexistent or unimportant in genetic evolution, DIT predicts that, due to the nature of cultural inheritance, it may be an important force in cultural evolution. Group selection occurs in cultural evolution because conformist biases make it difficult for novel cultural traits to spread through a population (see above section on transmission biases).

. As another example, it is likely that once culture became adaptive, genetic selection caused a refinement of the cognitive architecture that stores and transmits cultural information. This refinement may have further influenced the way culture is stored and the biases that govern its transmission. DIT also predicts that, under certain situations, cultural evolution may select for traits that are genetically maladap","According to the context, slowly changing aspects of social structure are explained by group selection in New Guinea.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.9,"The answer is partially correct.

What was the title of Friedrich Engels' manuscript in 1876?,The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man,". In 1876, Friedrich Engels wrote a manuscript titled The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man, accredited as a founding document of DIT; “The approach to gene-culture coevolution first developed by Engels and developed later on by anthropologists…” is described by Stephen Jay Gould as “…the best nineteenth-century case for gene-culture coevolution.” The idea that human cultures undergo a similar evolutionary process as genetic evolution also goes back to Darwin

. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Two of his later books were devoted to the study of animal emotions and psychology; The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex in 1871 and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals in 1872. Darwin's work inspired William James's functionalist approach to psychology

. Huxley convincingly illustrated many of the similarities and differences between humans and apes in his 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature.

What year did Richard Dawkins's book 'The Selfish Gene' introduce ideas of cultural evolution to a popular audience?,1976,". In the 1960s, Donald T. Campbell published some of the first theoretical work that adapted principles of evolutionary theory to the evolution of cultures. In 1976, two developments in cultural evolutionary theory set the stage for DIT. In that year Richard Dawkins's The Selfish Gene introduced ideas of cultural evolution to a popular audience. Although one of the best-selling science books of all time, because of its lack of mathematical rigor, it had little effect on the development of DIT

. However, this is not always the case. A study of African cultures showed that cultural history was a better predictor of cultural traits than local ecological conditions. Memetics, which comes from the meme idea described in Dawkins's The Selfish Gene, is similar to DIT in that it treats culture as an evolutionary process that is distinct from genetic transmission. However, there are some philosophical differences between memetics and DIT

What is a key criticism of sociology and cultural anthropology according to Dual Inheritance theorists?,That they treat culture as a static superorganic entity that dictates human behavior,". Two major topics of study in both sociology and cultural anthropology are human cultures and cultural variation. However, Dual Inheritance theorists charge that both disciplines too often treat culture as a static superorganic entity that dictates human behavior. Cultures are defined by a suite of common traits shared by a large group of people. DIT theorists argue that this doesn't sufficiently explain variation in cultural traits at the individual level

. Dual inheritance theory (DIT), developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has a slightly different perspective by trying to explain how human behavior is a product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: genetic evolution and cultural evolution.

What is the primary focus of evolutionary psychologists?,The evolved architecture of the human mind,". Evolutionary psychologists respond that they are working within a nature-nurture interactionist framework that acknowledges that many psychological adaptations are facultative (sensitive to environmental variations during individual development). The discipline is generally not focused on proximate analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations)

. Evolutionary psychology is primarily interested in finding commonalities between people, or basic human psychological nature. From an evolutionary perspective, the fact that people have fundamental differences in personality traits initially presents something of a puzzle. (Note: The field of behavioral genetics is concerned with statistically partitioning differences between people into genetic and environmental sources of variance

What is one key difference between the replication of genes and the spread of memes?,"Ideas normally are not copied faithfully as they are replicated, unlike genes.",". One difference is that memetics' focus is on the selection potential of discrete replicators (memes), where DIT allows for transmission of both non-replicators and non-discrete cultural variants.

When faced with a trait that seems maladaptive, some sociobiologists try to determine how the trait actually increases genetic fitness (maybe through kin selection or by speculating about early evolutionary environments).

Human behavioral ecology (HBE) and DIT have a similar relationship to what ecology and evolutionary biology have in the biological sciences.

What was the study of African cultures compared with?,local ecological conditions,". Evidence of behavioral modernity significantly earlier also exists from Africa, with older evidence of abstract imagery, widened subsistence strategies, more sophisticated tools and weapons, and other ""modern"" behaviors, and many scholars have recently argued that the transition to modernity occurred sooner than previously believed

. Two major topics of study in both sociology and cultural anthropology are human cultures and cultural variation. However, Dual Inheritance theorists charge that both disciplines too often treat culture as a static superorganic entity that dictates human behavior. Cultures are defined by a suite of common traits shared by a large group of people. DIT theorists argue that this doesn't sufficiently explain variation in cultural traits at the individual level

. The specific study of the origin and life of humans is anthropology, particularly paleoanthropology which focuses on the study of human prehistory. The closest living relatives of humans are bonobos and chimpanzees (both genus Pan) and gorillas (genus Gorilla). With the sequencing of both the human and chimpanzee genome, as of 2012[update] estimates of the similarity between their DNA sequences ","According to the context, there is no mention of studying African cultures.

What is one key difference between memetics and DIT?,DIT does not assume that replicators are necessary for cumulative adaptive evolution.,". One difference is that memetics' focus is on the selection potential of discrete replicators (memes), where DIT allows for transmission of both non-replicators and non-discrete cultural variants. DIT does not assume that replicators are necessary for cumulative adaptive evolution. DIT also more strongly emphasizes the role of genetic inheritance in shaping the capacity for cultural evolution. But perhaps the biggest difference is a difference in academic lineage

. However, this is not always the case. A study of African cultures showed that cultural history was a better predictor of cultural traits than local ecological conditions. Memetics, which comes from the meme idea described in Dawkins's The Selfish Gene, is similar to DIT in that it treats culture as an evolutionary process that is distinct from genetic transmission. However, there are some philosophical differences between memetics and DIT

. Memetics as a label is more influential in popular culture than in academia. Critics of memetics argue that it is lacking in empirical support or is conceptually ill-founded, and question whether there is hope for the memetic research program succeeding. Proponents point out that m","One key difference between memetics and DIT is that memetics focuses on the selection potential of discrete replicators (memes), whereas DIT does not assume that replicators are necessary for cumulative adaptive evolution.",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.7,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the key difference between memetics and DIT, highlighting the focus on discrete replicators in memetics while ignoring replicator necessity in DIT."
Who has criticized the memetic research program?,Liane Gabora,". Memetics as a label is more influential in popular culture than in academia. Critics of memetics argue that it is lacking in empirical support or is conceptually ill-founded, and question whether there is hope for the memetic research program succeeding. Proponents point out that many cultural traits are discrete, and that many existing models of cultural inheritance assume discrete cultural units, and hence involve memes. Israeli psychologist Liane Gabora has criticised DIT

. Similar criticisms are articulated by Subrena E. Smith of the University of New Hampshire. Evolutionary psychologists have addressed many of their critics (e.g. in books by Segerstråle (2000), Barkow (2005), and Alcock (2001)). Among their rebuttals are that some criticisms are straw men, or are based on an incorrect nature versus nurture dichotomy or on basic misunderstandings of the discipline. Robert Kurzban suggested that ""..

What is one criticism leveled against framing culture in tandem with evolution?,That it does not capture the algorithmic structure that makes an inheritance system require a particular kind of mathematical framework,". She argues that traits that are not transmitted by way of a self-assembly code (as in genetic evolution) is misleading, because this second use does not capture the algorithmic structure that makes an inheritance system require a particular kind of mathematical framework. Other criticisms of the effort to frame culture in tandem with evolution have been leveled by Richard Lewontin, Niles Eldredge, and Stuart Kauffman

. As another example, it is likely that once culture became adaptive, genetic selection caused a refinement of the cognitive architecture that stores and transmits cultural information. This refinement may have further influenced the way culture is stored and the biases that govern its transmission. DIT also predicts that, under certain situations, cultural evolution may select for traits that are genetically maladaptive

What is the approximate time period when the tribe Hominini formed?,7 to 8 million years ago,". --- # List of human evolution fossils The following tables give an overview of notable finds of hominin fossils and remains relating to human evolution, beginning with the formation of the tribe Hominini (the divergence of the human and chimpanzee lineages) in the late Miocene, roughly 7 to 8 million years ago

. Wood and Richmond (2000) proposed that Hominini (""hominins"") be designated as a tribe that comprised all species of early humans and pre-humans ancestral to humans back to after the chimpanzee–human last common ancestor, and that Hominina be designated a subtribe of Hominini to include only the genus Homo — that is, not including the earlier upright walking hominins of the Pliocene such as Australopithecus, Orrorin tugenensis, Ardipithecus, or Sahelanthropus

. Hominidae subfamily Homininae (African hominids) diverged from Ponginae (orangutans) about 14 mya. Hominins (including humans and the Australopithecine and Panina subtribes) parted from the Gorillini tribe (gorillas) between 8 and 9 mya; Australopithecine (including the extinct biped ancestors of humans) separated from the Pan genus (containing chimpanzees and bonobos) 4–7 mya.

What is the primary method used to determine the age of the fossils?,radiometric dating,". As there are thousands of fossils, mostly fragmentary, often consisting of single bones or isolated teeth with complete skulls and skeletons rare, this overview is not complete, but shows some of the most important findings. The fossils are arranged by approximate age as determined by radiometric dating and/or incremental dating and the species name represents current consensus; if there is no clear scientific consensus the other possible classifications are indicated

. Once a specimen is collected from an archaeological site, DNA can be extracted through a series of processes. One of the more common methods utilizes silica and takes advantage of polymerase chain reactions in order to collect ancient DNA from bone samples. There are several challenges that add to the difficulty when attempting to extract ancient DNA from fossils and prepare it for analysis. DNA is continuously being split up

. The identity of the fossil remain can be uncovered by comparing its DNA sequence with those of known species using software such as BLASTN. This archaeogenetic approach is especially helpful when the morphology of the fossil is ambiguous. Apart from that, species identification can also b","According to the context, the primary methods used to determine the age of the fossils are:

What is the approximate time when all fossils shown were considered to be Homo sapiens?,"11,500 years ago",". The early fossils shown are not considered ancestors to Homo sapiens but are closely related to ancestors and are therefore important to the study of the lineage. After 1.5 million years ago (extinction of Paranthropus), all fossils shown are human (genus Homo). After 11,500 years ago (11.5 ka, beginning of the Holocene), all fossils shown are Homo sapiens (anatomically modern humans), illustrating recent divergence in the formation of modern human sub-populations

.[e] Fossils of early Homo sapiens were found in Qafzeh and Es-Skhul Caves in Israel and have been dated to 80,000 to 120,000 years ago. These humans seem to have either become extinct or retreated back to Africa 70,000 to 80,000 years ago, possibly replaced by southbound Neanderthals escaping the colder regions of ice-age Europe. Hua Liu et al. analyzed autosomal microsatellite markers dating to about 56,000 years ago

. Neanderthals and Denisovans emerge from the northern Homo heidelbergensis lineage around 500-450 ka while sapients emerge from the southern lineage around 350-300 ka.

When did the chimpanzee–human divergence likely take place?,10 to 7 million years ago,". The chimpanzee–human divergence likely took place around 10 to 7 million years ago. The list of fossils begins with Graecopithecus, dated some 7.2 million years ago, which may or may not still be ancestral to both the human and the chimpanzee lineage. For the earlier history of the human lineage, see Timeline of human evolution#Hominidae, Hominidae#Phylogeny

. An estimate of 10 to 13 million years for the CHLCA was proposed in 1998, and a range of 7 to 10 million years ago is assumed by White and colleagues in 2009. A 2016 study analyzed transitions at CpG sites in genome sequences, which exhibit a more clocklike behavior than other substitutions, arriving at an estimate for human and chimpanzee divergence time of 12.1 million years. Studies in the early 2020s suggest a more recent CHLCA, such as between 9.3 and 6

. In their seminal 1967 paper in Science, Sarich and Wilson estimated the divergence time of humans and apes as four to five million years ago, at a time when standard interpretations of the fossil record gave this divergence as at least 10 to as much as 30 million years.

"What is the approximate age when the modern human species, Homo sapiens, began to evolve?",4 billion years ago,". Neanderthals and Denisovans emerge from the northern Homo heidelbergensis lineage around 500-450 ka while sapients emerge from the southern lineage around 350-300 ka. Fossils attributed to H. sapiens, along with stone tools, dated to approximately 300,000 years ago, found at Jebel Irhoud, Morocco yield the earliest fossil evidence for anatomically modern Homo sapiens.

It includes brief explanations of the various taxonomic ranks in the human lineage

. In September 2019, scientists reported the computerized determination, based on 260 CT scans, of a virtual skull shape of the last common human ancestor to anatomically modern humans, representative of the earliest modern humans, and suggested that modern humans arose between 260,000 and 350,000 years ago through a merging of populations in East and South Afri","According to the context, the answer is approximately 350-300 ka (thousand years ago). This is when sapients emerge from the southern lineage.",0.95,0.9,0.85,0.75,0.9,The LLM generated answer is closer to the estimated age of 350-300 ka than the ground truth answer of 4 billion years ago.
What type of organisms are mentioned as continuing to diversify undisturbed?,Prokaryotes,". The timeline reflects the mainstream views in modern taxonomy, based on the principle of phylogenetic nomenclature; in cases of open questions with no clear consensus, the main competing possibilities are briefly outlined. A tabular overview of the taxonomic ranking of Homo sapiens (with age estimates for each rank) is shown below. For another billion years, prokaryotes would continue to diversify undisturbed

. The two alternative hypotheses are a relative absence of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN < dS; ω < 1), suggesting the effect on fitness ('fitness effect', or 'selection pressure') of such mutations is negative (purifying selection has operated over time); or a relative excess of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN > dS; ω > 1), indicating positive effect on fitness, i.e. diversifying selection (Yang and Bielawski 2000)

. Adaptive divergence associated with chromosomal rearrangements led to rapid radiation of the four genera within the Hylobatidae lineage between about 7 to 5 Mya. Each genus comprises a distinct, well-delineated lineage, but the sequence and timing of divergences among these genera have been hard to resolve due to radiative speciations and extensive incomplet",Prokaryotes.,1.0,0.7,0.8,0.6,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the taxonomic group as prokaryotes, which are organisms without a nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles. However, the answer could have been more specific about the type of organisms, such as bacteria or archaea."
What is considered the best living example of the ancestor of all animals?,Proterospongia,". The Holozoa lineage of eukaryotes evolves many features for making cell colonies, and finally leads to the ancestor of animals (metazoans) and choanoflagellates. Proterospongia (members of the Choanoflagellata) are the best living examples of what the ancestor of all animals may have looked like. They live in colonies, and show a primitive level of cellular specialization for different tasks

What is a characteristic that diploblasts possess?,"Epithelia, nerves, muscles, connective tissue, and mouths",". All diploblasts possess epithelia, nerves, muscles and connective tissue and mouths, and except for placozoans, have some form of symmetry, with their ancestors probably having radial symmetry like that of cnidarians. Diploblasts separated their early embryonic cells into two germ layers (ecto- and endoderm). Photoreceptive eye-spots evolve

. Erythrocytes and thrombocytes lose their nuclei while lymphatic systems and advanced immunity emerge. They may have also had thicker dermis like mammals today. The jaws of cynodonts resembled modern mammal jaws; the anterior portion, the dentary, held differentiated teeth. This group of animals likely contains a species which is the ancestor of all modern mammals. Their temporal fenestrae merged with their orbits

What is the earliest development that bilateral symmetry is observed in?,Nephrozoa,". Earliest development of bilateral symmetry, mesoderm, head (anterior cephalization) and various gut muscles (and thus peristalsis) and, in the Nephrozoa, nephridia (kidney precursors), coelom (or maybe pseudocoelom), distinct mouth and anus (evolution of through-gut), and possibly even nerve cords and blood vessels. Reproductive tissue probably concentrates into a pair of gonads connecting just before the posterior orifice

. In utero development and malformations were correlated in severity. Freiston and Galis look at the development of ribs, digits, and mammalian asymmetry. They argue that this construction is relevant for the study of disease, the consistency in evolution of body plans, and understanding of developmental constraints. Sexual dimorphism in prenatal digit ratio was found as early as 14 weeks and was maintained whether or not the fleshy finger part was included

""Cup-eyes"" and balance organs evolve (the function of hearing added later as the more complex inner ear evolves in vertebrates). The nephrozoan through-gut had a wider portion in the front, called the pharynx. The integument or skin consists of an epithelial layer (epidermis) and a connective layer

. Evolutionary psychologists say that animals from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance, suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge. Building and maintaining sense organs is metabolically expensive, so these organs evolve only when they improve an organism's fitness

. Bipedalism raises the head; this allows a greater field of vision with improved detection of distant dangers or resources, access to deeper water for wading animals and allows the animals to reach higher food sources with their mouths.

All chordates except tunicates sport an intricate, closed circulatory system, with highly branched blood vessels

. Olfactores, last common ancestor of tunicates and vertebrates in which olfaction (smell) evolved.

"When did the first vertebrates, or 'fish', appear?",The first vertebrates ('fish') appear: the Agnathans,". These ""fishapods"" had more ossified and stronger bones to support themselves on land (especially skull and limb bones). Jaw bones fuse together while gill and opercular bones disappear. Pederpes from around 350 Ma indicates that the standard number of 5 digits evolved at the Early Carboniferous, when modern tetrapods (or ""amphibians"") split in two directions (one leading to the extant amphibians and the other to amniotes)

. Dorsal, anal and tail fins all disappeared. Lissamphibia (extant amphibians) retain many features of early amphibians but they have only four digits (caecilians have none). From amphibians came the first amniotes: Hylonomus, a primitive reptile, is the earliest amniote known. It was 20 cm (8 in) long (including the tail) and probably would have looked rather similar to modern lizards. It had small sharp teeth and probably ate small millipedes and insects

. Most known animal phyla appeared in the fossil record as marine species during the Ediacaran-Cambrian explosion, probably caused by long scale oxygenation since around 585 Ma (sometimes called the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event or NOE) and also an influx of oceanic minerals.

What characteristic did ancient fish share with their descendants?,Seven pairs of pharyngeal arches,". They depended on gills for respiration and evolved the unique sense of taste (the remaining sense of the skin now called ""touch""), endothelia, camera eyes and inner ears (capable of hearing and balancing; each consists of a lagena, an otolithic organ and two semicircular canals) as well as livers, thyroids, kidneys and two-chambered hearts (one atrium and one ventricle). They had a tail fin but lacked the paired (pectoral and pelvic) fins of more advanced fish

. Primitive tetrapods (""fishapods"") developed from tetrapodomorphs with a two-lobed brain in a flattened skull, a wide mouth and a medium snout, whose upward-facing eyes show that it was a bottom-dweller, and which had already developed adaptations of fins with fleshy bases and bones. (The ""living fossil"" coelacanth is a related lobe-finned fish without these shallow-water adaptations.) Tetrapod fishes used their fins as paddles in shallow-water habitats choked with plants and detritus

What type of organs did they have?,"Livers, thyroids, kidneys",". They depended on gills for respiration and evolved the unique sense of taste (the remaining sense of the skin now called ""touch""), endothelia, camera eyes and inner ears (capable of hearing and balancing; each consists of a lagena, an otolithic organ and two semicircular canals) as well as livers, thyroids, kidneys and two-chambered hearts (one atrium and one ventricle). They had a tail fin but lacked the paired (pectoral and pelvic) fins of more advanced fish

. They progressively started to develop cardiovascular systems, respiratory systems and immune systems to survive in their environments, which required bodies to have something more complex than the limited quality of cells to regulate themselves. This encouraged the nervous systems of many creatures to develop into a brain, which was sizeable and strikingly similar to how most animal brains look today

. At this stage, our ancestors evolved vomeronasal organs, salivary glands, tongues, parathyroid glands, three-chambered hearts (with two atria and one ventricle) and bladders, and completely removed their gills by adulthood. The glottis evolves to prevent food going into the respiratory tract. Lungs and thin, moist skin al","According to the context, they had:

What are the Placodermi characterized by?,The evolution of jaws from the first gill/pharyngeal arch and replacing endoskeletal cartilage with bone,". Placoderms had competition with the previous dominant animals, the cephalopods and sea scorpions, and rose to dominance themselves. A lineage of them probably evolved into the bony and cartilaginous fish, after evolving scales, teeth (which allowed the transition to full carnivory), stomachs, spleens, thymuses, myelin sheaths, hemoglobin and advanced, adaptive immunity (the latter two occurred independently in the lampreys and hagfish)

The universal tetrapod characteristics of front limbs that bend backward at the elbow and hind limbs that bend forward at the knee can plausibly be traced to early tetrapods living in shallow water. Panderichthys is a 90–130 cm (35–50 in) long fish from the Late Devonian period (380 Mya). It has a large tetrapod-like head. Panderichthys exhibits features transitional between lobe-finned fishes and early tetrapods

. All diploblasts possess epithelia, nerves, muscles and connective tissue and mouths, and except for placozoans, have some form of symmetry, with their ancestors probably having radial symmetry like that of cnidarians.

What is the result of the bones from the first gill arch becoming?,The upper and lower jaw,". Bones of the first gill arch became the upper and lower jaw, while those from the second arch became the hyomandibula, ceratohyal and basihyal; this closed two of the seven pairs of gills. The gap between the first and second arches just below the braincase (fused with upper jaw) created a pair of spiracles, which opened in the skin and led to the pharynx (water passed through them and left through gills)

. Ancestral chordates evolved a post-anal tail, notochord, and endostyle (precursor of thyroid). The pharyngeal slits (or gills) are now supported by connective tissue and used for filter feeding and possibly breathing. The first of these basal chordates to be discovered by science was Pikaia gracilens. Other, earlier chordate predecessors include Myllokunmingia fengjiaoa, Yunnanozoon lividum, and Haikouichthys ercaicunensis

What type of animals did placoderms rise to dominance against?,Cephalopods and sea scorpions,". Placoderms had competition with the previous dominant animals, the cephalopods and sea scorpions, and rose to dominance themselves. A lineage of them probably evolved into the bony and cartilaginous fish, after evolving scales, teeth (which allowed the transition to full carnivory), stomachs, spleens, thymuses, myelin sheaths, hemoglobin and advanced, adaptive immunity (the latter two occurred independently in the lampreys and hagfish)

. They first appeared in the fossil record around 66 million years ago, soon after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that eliminated about three-quarters of plant and animal species on Earth, including most dinosaurs. One of the last Plesiadapiformes is Carpolestes simpsoni, having grasping digits but not forward-facing eyes. Simians split into infraorders Platyrrhini and Catarrhini

What feature do jawed fish have that is different from other fish?,"A third, lateral semicircular canal",". Jawed fish also have a third, lateral semicircular canal and their otoliths are divided between a saccule and utricle. Some freshwater lobe-finned fish (sarcopterygii) develop limbs and give rise to the Tetrapodomorpha.

What is a characteristic of the bellies of these ancient creatures?,They had scalelessness,". The species is characterized by a body mass and stature similar to small-bodied human populations, a smaller endocranial volume similar to Australopithecus, and a cranial morphology (skull shape) similar to early Homo species.

What is a key innovation that allows amniotes to reproduce on land?,The evolution of the amniotic egg,". It is a precursor of later amniotes (including both the reptiles and the ancestors of mammals). Alpha keratin first evolves here; it is used in the claws of modern amniotes, and hair in mammals, indicating claws and a different type of scales evolved in amniotes (complete loss of gills as well). Evolution of the amniotic egg allows the amniotes to reproduce on land and lay shelled eggs on dry land. They did not need to return to water for reproduction nor breathing

. This adaptation and the desiccation-resistant scales gave them the capability to inhabit the uplands for the first time, albeit making them drink water through their mouths.

The therapsids had temporal fenestrae larger and more mammal-like than pelycosaurs, their teeth showed more serial differentiation, their gait was semi-erect and later forms had evolved a secondary palate

. Ancestral chordates evolved a post-anal tail, notochord, and endostyle (precursor of thyroid). The pharyngeal slits (or gills) are now supported by connective tissue and used for filter feeding and possibly breathing. The first of these basal chordates to be discovered by science was Pikaia gracilens. Other, earlier chordate predecessors include Myllokunmingia fengjiaoa, Yunnanozoon lividum, and Haikouichthys ercaicunensis

. Dorsal, anal and tail fins all disappeared. Lissamphibia (extant amphibians) retain many features of early amphibians but they have only four digits (caecilians have none). From amphibians came the first amniotes: Hylonomus, a primitive reptile, is the earliest amniote known. It was 20 cm (8 in) long (including the ta","According to the context, the earliest synapsids, or ""proto-mammals,"" are also referred to as pelycosaurs.",0.8,0.6,0.9,0.7,0.8,"The LLM's answer is somewhat relevant, but it does not accurately match the ground truth answer."
What is a characteristic of the lung parenchyma in therapsids?,Ending in highly vascularized alveoli,". A secondary palate enables the animal to eat and breathe at the same time and is a sign of a more active, perhaps warm-blooded, way of life. They had lost gastralia and, possibly, scales. One subgroup of therapsids, the cynodonts, lose pineal eye and lumbar ribs and very likely became warm-blooded. The lower respiratory tract forms intricate branches in the lung parenchyma, ending in highly vascularized alveoli

. Compared with nonhuman primates, humans have significantly enhanced control of breathing, enabling exhalations to be extended and inhalations shortened as we speak. Whilst we are speaking, intercostal and interior abdominal muscles are recruited to expand the thorax and draw air into the lungs, and subsequently to control the release of air as the lungs deflate. The muscles concerned are markedly more innervated in humans than in nonhuman primates

What characteristic did the jaws of cynodonts resemble?,Modern mammal jaws,". Erythrocytes and thrombocytes lose their nuclei while lymphatic systems and advanced immunity emerge. They may have also had thicker dermis like mammals today. The jaws of cynodonts resembled modern mammal jaws; the anterior portion, the dentary, held differentiated teeth. This group of animals likely contains a species which is the ancestor of all modern mammals. Their temporal fenestrae merged with their orbits

. The molars of Australopithecus fit together in much the same way those of humans do, with low crowns and four low, rounded cusps used for crushing. They have cutting edges on the crests. However, australopiths generally evolved a larger postcanine dentition with thicker enamel. Australopiths in general had thick enamel, like Homo, while other great apes have markedly thinner enamel. Robust australopiths wore their molar surfaces down flat, unlike the more gracile species, who kept their crests

What was lost by early mammals as a result of transitioning to nocturnality?,The vision of red and ultraviolet light,". Their hindlimbs became erect and their posterior bones of the jaw progressively shrunk to the region of the columella. From Eucynodontia came the first mammals. Most early mammals were small shrew-like animals that fed on insects and had transitioned to nocturnality to avoid competition with the dominant archosaurs — this led to the loss of the vision of red and ultraviolet light (ancestral tetrachromacy of vertebrates reduced to dichromacy)

. During primate evolution, a shift from nocturnal to diurnal activity in tarsiers, monkeys and apes (the haplorhines) brought with it an increased reliance on vision at the expense of olfaction. As a result, the snout became reduced and the rhinarium or ""wet nose"" was lost. The muscles of the face and lips consequently became less constrained, enabling their co-option to serve purposes of facial expression. The lips also became thicker, and the oral cavity hidden behind became smaller

What is likely about the body temperature of these animals?,constant,". Although there is no evidence in the fossil record, it is likely that these animals had a constant body temperature, hair and milk glands for their young (the glands stemmed from the milk line). The neocortex (part of the cerebrum) region of the brain evolves in Mammalia, at the reduction of the tectum (non-smell senses which were processed here became integrated into neocortex but smell became primary sense)

. There has been a great deal of research done on developmental adjustment, acclimatization, and cultural practices, but less research on genetic adaptations to colder and hotter temperatures. The human body always works to remain in homeostasis. One form of homeostasis is thermoregulation. Body temperature varies in every individual, but the average internal temperature is 37.0 °C (98.6 °F)

. Humans colonised the environment west of the Urals, hunting reindeer especially, but were faced with adaptive challenges; winter temperatures averaged from −20 to −30 °C (−4 to −22 °F) with fuel and shelter scarce. They travelled on foot and relied on hunting highly mobile herds for food

What is a distinctive characteristic of monotremes and therians regarding their hearing?,They detach the malleus and incus from the dentary and combine them to the stapes in the tympanic cavity.,". Monotremes and therians independently detach the malleus and incus from the dentary (lower jaw) and combine them to the shrunken columella (now called stapes) in the tympanic cavity behind the eardrum (which is connected to the malleus and held by another bone detached from the dentary, the tympanic plus ectotympanic), and coil their lagena (cochlea) to advance their hearing, with therians further evolving an external pinna and erect forelimbs

. It is possible that Ar. ramidus had vocal capability approximating that of chimpanzees and bonobos, with its idiosyncratic skull morphology not resulting in any significant advances in speech capability. In this sense the anatomical features analysed in this essay would have been exapted in later more voluble species of hominin

. Larger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their size. The range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation.

An early stem-primate, Plesiadapis, still had claws and eyes on the side of the head, making it faster on the ground than in the trees, but it began to spend long times on lower branches, feeding on fruits and leaves. The Plesiadapiformes very likely contain the ancestor species of all primates

.(pp 5–6) As creatures acquired a variety of senses for perception, animals progressed to develop allostasis, which played the role of an early brain by forcing the body to gather past experiences to improve prediction.

Are male platyrrhines color blind?,true,". They fully transitioned to diurnality and lacked any claw and tapetum lucidum (which evolved many times in various vertebrates). They possibly evolved at least some of the paranasal sinuses, and transitioned from estrous cycle to menstrual cycle. The number of mammaries is now reduced to only one thoracic pair. Platyrrhines, New World monkeys, have prehensile tails and males are color blind

. Human trichromatic color vision had its genetic origins in this period. Catarrhines lost the vomeronasal organ (or possibly reduced it to vestigial status). Proconsul was an early genus of catarrhine primates. They had a mixture of Old World monkey and ape characteristics. Proconsul's monkey-like features include thin tooth enamel, a light build with a narrow chest and short forelimbs, and an arboreal quadrupedal lifestyle

What is the favored hypothesis for how the ancestors of Platyrrhini migrated to South America?,a land bridge,". The individuals whose descendants would become Platyrrhini are conjectured to have migrated to South America either on a raft of vegetation or via a land bridge (the hypothesis now favored). Catarrhines mostly stayed in Africa as the two continents drifted apart. Possible early ancestors of catarrhines include Aegyptopithecus and Saadanius. Catarrhini splits into 2 superfamilies, Old World monkeys (Cercopithecoidea) and apes (Hominoidea)

. The traditional theory is that these early migrants moved when sea levels were significantly lowered due to the Quaternary glaciation, following herds of now-extinct pleistocene megafauna along ice-free corridors that stretched between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets. Another route proposed is that, either on foot or using primitive boats, they migrated down the Pacific coast to South America as far as Chile

. For example, one hypothesis proposes a migration from Siberia to South America 20–15 kya and a second migration that occurred after glacial recession. Y-chromosome data has led some to hold that there was a single migration starting from the Altai Mountains of Siberia between 17.2 and 10.1 kya, after the LGM.

. A research program by geneticist Hans Eiberg and his team at the University of Copenhagen from the 1990s to 2000s investigating the origins of blue eyes revealed that a mutation in the gene OCA2 is responsible for this trait. According to them, all humans initially had brown eyes and the OCA2 mutation took place between 6,000 and 10,000 years ago. It dilutes the production of melanin, responsible for the pigmentation of human hair, eye, and skin color

. Pigmentation genes show particularly strong evidence of adaptive evolution in non-African populations (Williamson et al. 2007). This is likely to be because those humans that left Africa approximately 50,000 years ago, entered less sunny climates, and so were under new selection pressures to obtain enough Vi","Based on the provided context, the answer is:

What are some ape-like features shared by Proconsul africanus?,"lack of a tail, ape-like elbows, and slightly larger brain relative to body size",". Its ape-like features are its lack of a tail, ape-like elbows, and a slightly larger brain relative to body size. Proconsul africanus is a possible ancestor of both great and lesser apes, including humans. Pierolapithecus catalaunicus is thought to be a common ancestor of humans and the other great apes, or at least a species that brings us closer to a common ancestor than any previous fossil discovery

What special adaptations did the earliest known human ancestors have for tree climbing?,"A wide, flat rib cage, a stiff lower spine, flexible wrists, and shoulder blades that lie along its back.",". The fossil evidence reveals that early bipedal hominins were still adapted to climbing trees at the time they were also walking upright. It is possible that bipedalism evolved in the trees, and was later applied to the savanna as a vestigial trait

. It had the special adaptations for tree climbing as do present-day humans and other great apes: a wide, flat rib cage, a stiff lower spine, flexible wrists, and shoulder blades that lie along its back. Hominini: The latest common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees is estimated to have lived between roughly 10 to 5 million years ago

. Humans and orangutans are both unique to a bipedal reactive adaptation when climbing on thin branches, in which they have increased hip and knee extension in relation to the diameter of the branch, which can increase an arboreal feeding range and can be attributed to a convergent evolution of bipedalism evolving in arboreal environments

. This aided in balance when in the trees but lost its prominence when bipedalism was adapted. The arms also became shorter (opposite in comparison to legs) for carrying objects and using them as multi-tasking agents instead of climbing and swinging in trees.

What is the estimated time when speciation may have begun between chimpanzees and humans?,10 Ma,". The chimpanzee–human divergence likely took place around 10 to 7 million years ago. The list of fossils begins with Graecopithecus, dated some 7.2 million years ago, which may or may not still be ancestral to both the human and the chimpanzee lineage. For the earlier history of the human lineage, see Timeline of human evolution#Hominidae, Hominidae#Phylogeny

. An estimate of 10 to 13 million years for the CHLCA was proposed in 1998, and a range of 7 to 10 million years ago is assumed by White and colleagues in 2009. A 2016 study analyzed transitions at CpG sites in genome sequences, which exhibit a more clocklike behavior than other substitutions, arriving at an estimate for human and chimpanzee divergence time of 12.1 million years. Studies in the early 2020s suggest a more recent CHLCA, such as between 9.3 and 6

. Both chimpanzees and humans have a larynx that repositions during the first two years of life to a spot between the pharynx and the lungs, indicating that the common ancestors have this feature, a precondition for vocalized speech in humans.

What was the estimated brain size of A. afarensis?,380-430 cm3,". It is thought that A. afarensis was ancestral to both the genus Australopithecus and the genus Homo. Compared to the modern and extinct great apes, A. afarensis had reduced canines and molars, although they were still relatively larger than in modern humans. A. afarensis also has a relatively small brain size (380–430 cm3) and a prognathic (anterior-projecting) face. Australopithecines have been found in savannah environments; they probably developed their diet to include scavenged meat

What age did Australopithecus garhi start using stone tools?,2.5 Ma,". A. garhi was associated with large mammal bones bearing evidence of processing by stone tools, which may indicate australopithecine tool production. Stone tools dating to roughly the same time as A. garhi (about 2.6 mya) were later discovered at the nearby Gona and Ledi-Geraru sites, but the appearance of Homo at Ledi-Geraru (LD 350-1) casts doubt on australopithecine authorship.

"What percentage of DNA do humans share with their closest living evolutionary relative, the chimpanzees?",95-99%,". Human DNA is approximately 98.4% identical to that of chimpanzees when comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms (see human evolutionary genetics). The fossil record, however, of gorillas and chimpanzees is limited; both poor preservation – rain forest soils tend to be acidic and dissolve bone – and sampling bias probably contribute to this problem

What was previously thought to be a likely candidate for the last common ancestor of the Neanderthal and modern human lineages?,Homo heidelbergensis,". Homo heidelbergensis (in Africa also known as Homo rhodesiensis) had long been thought to be a likely candidate for the last common ancestor of the Neanderthal and modern human lineages. However, genetic evidence from the Sima de los Huesos fossils published in 2016 seems to suggest that H

. Genetic evidence suggests that a species dubbed Homo heidelbergensis is the last common ancestor of Neanderthals, Denisovans, and Homo sapiens. This common ancestor lived between 600,000 and 750,000 years ago, likely in either Europe or Africa

. All these may have all contributed to modern Homo sapiens replacing Neanderthal populations by 28,000 BP. Earlier evidence from sequencing mitochondrial DNA suggested that no significant gene flow occurred between H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens, and that the two were separate species that shared a common ancestor about 660,000 years ago. However, a sequencing of the Neanderthal genome in 2010 indicated that Neanderthals did indeed interbreed with anatomically modern humans c

What is one possible reason for the increase in human intelligence 0.2 Ma?,extinction of most African megafauna,". This brain increase manifested during postnatal brain growth, far exceeding that of other apes (heterochrony). It also allowed for extended periods of social learning and language acquisition in juvenile humans, beginning as much as 2 million years ago. Encephalization may be due to a dependency on calorie-dense, difficult-to-acquire food. Furthermore, the changes in the structure of human brains may be even more significant than the increase in size

What is the primary function of intelligence in the context mentioned?,Survival,". The fundamental importance of animal social skills lies within the ability to manage relationships and in turn, the ability to not just commit information to memory, but manipulate it as well. An adaptive response to the challenges of social interaction and living is theory of mind. Theory of mind as defined by Martin Brüne, is the ability to infer another individual's mental states or emotions. Having a strong theory of mind is tied closely with possessing advanced social intelligence

. Current consensus about the evolutionary development of the human brain accepts sexual selection as a potential contributing factor but maintains that human intelligence and the ability to store and share cultural knowledge would have likely carried high survival value as well

. The brain allows an individual to recognize patterns, perceive speech, develop strategies to circumvent ecologically-based problems such as foraging for food, and also permits the phenomenon of color vision.

When did humans stop their brain expansion?,By 200 ka,". During human evolution, on at least two occasions, hominid brain size increased rapidly over a short period of time followed by a period of stasis.

What did Hirszfeld discover in 1919 during his study at the Macedonian front?,That there was no correlation between hair color and blood type,". He founded blood group inheritance with Erich von Dungern in 1910, and contributed to it greatly throughout his life. He studied ABO blood groups. In one of his studies in 1919, Hirszfeld documented the ABO blood groups and hair color of people at the Macedonian front, leading to his discovery that the hair color and blood type had no correlation. In addition to that he observed that there was a decrease of blood group A from western Europe to India and the opposite for blood group B

. He hypothesized that the east-to-west blood group ratio stemmed from two blood groups consisting of mainly A or B mutating from blood group O, and mixing through migration or intermingling. A majority of his work was researching the links of blood types to sex, disease, climate, age, social class, and race. His work led him to discover that peptic ulcer was more dominant in blood group O, and that AB blood type mothers had a high male-to-female birth ratio

. Work did not resume until 1921, when the Austrian paleontologist, Otto Zdansky, fresh with his doctoral degree from Vienna, came to Beijing to work for Andersson.

. Greater overall body fat percentage in human females appears to be unique among primates and may function in storing resources needed to gestate and support large-brained offspring as well as in sexual selection. For example, higher female body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased fertility in young women, particularly those in subsistence societies. Lower WHR, lower BMI, and smaller waist sizes are also associated with lower birth weights and higher infant mortality

Silica-based DNA extraction is a method used as a purification step to extract DNA from archaeological bone artifacts and yield DNA that can be amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. This process works by using silica as a means to bind DNA and separate it from other components of the fossil process that inhibit PCR amplification

.g. treated f","According to the context, Massive parallel sequencing is the type of sequencing technology commonly used to analyze DNA extracted from fossil remains.",0.8,0.9,0.7,0.6,0.9,"The LLM-generated answer provides the correct terminology but the context does not specify the type of sequencing technology used, which is crucial for accurately assessing its suitability for analyzing DNA extracted from fossil remains."
What is one method used for massive parallel sequencing?,"One method of massive parallel sequencing, developed by Margulies et al",". It involves attaching a generic sequence to every single strand that generic primers can bond to, and thus all of the DNA present is amplified. This is generally more costly and time intensive than PCR but due to the difficulties involved in ancient DNA amplification it is cheaper and more efficient. One method of massive parallel sequencing, developed by Margulies et al

. There can also be “jumping PCR” which causes recombination during the PCR process which can make analyzing the DNA more difficult in inhomogeneous samples. DNA extracted from fossil remains is primarily sequenced using Massive parallel sequencing, which allows simultaneous amplification and sequencing of all DNA segments in a sample, even when it is highly fragmented and of low concentration

. These genomic methods can also be applied to search for adaptive evolution in non-coding DNA, where putatively neutral sites are hard to identify (Ponting and Lunter 2006). Another recent method used to detect selection in non-coding sequences examines insertions and deletions (indels), rather than point mutations (Lunter et al. 2006), although the method has only been applied to examine patterns of negative selection

","According to the context, one method of massive parallel sequencing developed by Margulies et al involves attaching a generic sequence to every single strand that generic primers can bond to, and thus all of the DNA present is amplified.",0.8,0.6,0.7,0.5,0.0,"The LLM generated answer provides a good overview of the method described in the context, but it could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation and including additional details about the method."
What type of PCR does the employed method use?,bead-based emulsion PCR,".g. treated fossils for museums). Also, contamination poses a risk for all DNA replication in general, and this method may result in misleading results if applied to contaminated material. Polymerase chain reaction is a process that can amplify segments of DNA and is often used on extracted ancient DNA. It has three main steps: denaturation, annealing, and extension. Denaturation splits the DNA into two single strands at high temperatures

. It involves attaching a generic sequence to every single strand that generic primers can bond to, and thus all of the DNA present is amplified. This is generally more costly and time intensive than PCR but due to the difficulties involved in ancient DNA amplification it is cheaper and more efficient.

DNA extracted from fossil remains is primarily sequenced using Massive parallel sequencing, which allows simultaneous amplification and sequencing of all DNA segments in a sample, even when it is highly fragmented and of ","Based on the context, the answer is:

The employed method uses ""Massive parallel sequencing"" (not a specific type of PCR), which allows simultaneous amplification and sequencing of all DNA segments in a sample.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.9,"The LLM generated answer provides some correct information but lacks nuance and fails to capture the complexity of PCR, which involves specific primers and annealing steps."
What software tool is used to compare DNA sequences with those of known species?,BLASTN,". The identity of the fossil remain can be uncovered by comparing its DNA sequence with those of known species using software such as BLASTN. This archaeogenetic approach is especially helpful when the morphology of the fossil is ambiguous. Apart from that, species identification can also be done by finding specific genetic markers in an aDNA sequence. For example, the American indigenous population is characterized by specific mitochondrial RFLPs and deletions defined by Wallace et al

. aDNA comparison study can also reveal the evolutionary relationship between two species. The number of base differences between DNA of an ancient species and that of a closely related extant species can be used to estimate the divergence time of those two species from their last common ancestor. The phylogeny of some extinct species, such as Australian marsupial wolves and American ground sloths, has been constructed by this method

. Mitochondrial DNA in animals and chloroplast DNA in plants are usually used for this purpose because they have hundreds of copies per cell and thus are more easily accessible in ancient fossils. Another method to investigate relationship between two species is throug","According to the context, the software tool used to compare DNA sequences with those of known species is BLASTN.",1.0,0.8,0.7,0.9,0.0,"The LLM's answer is correct, but it is not as relevant or similar to the ground truth as it should be. The context could be more specific and provide more context for the comparison."
What is a common application of aDNA comparison studies in evolutionary biology?,Estimating the divergence time of two species from their last common ancestor,". aDNA comparison study can also reveal the evolutionary relationship between two species. The number of base differences between DNA of an ancient species and that of a closely related extant species can be used to estimate the divergence time of those two species from their last common ancestor. The phylogeny of some extinct species, such as Australian marsupial wolves and American ground sloths, has been constructed by this method

. This suggests that humans and Neanderthals are not as closely related as two individuals of the same species are, but they are more related to each other than to chimpanzees. There have also been some attempts to decipher aDNA to provide valuable phenotypic information of ancient species. This is always done by mapping aDNA sequence onto the karyotype of a well-studied closely related species, which share a lot of similar phenotypic traits. For example, Green et al

. For example, Green et al. compared the aDNA sequence from Neanderthal Vi-80 fossil with modern human X and Y chromosome sequence, and they found a similarity in 2.18 and 1.62 bases per 10,000 respectively, suggesting Vi-80 sample was from a male individual. Other similar studies includ","According to the context, a common application of aDNA comparison studies in evolutionary biology is to estimate the divergence time of two species from their last common ancestor by comparing the number of base differences between ancient and extant species DNA.",0.7,0.8,0.9,0.5,0.8,"The LLM correctly identifies the main application of aDNA comparison studies in evolutionary biology as estimating the divergence time of two species from their last common ancestor, but it provides a somewhat misleading context due to the mention of base differences rather than the actual purpose of the technique."
What type of DNA is usually used for investigating relationships between two species?,Mitochondrial DNA in animals and chloroplast DNA in plants,". Mitochondrial DNA in animals and chloroplast DNA in plants are usually used for this purpose because they have hundreds of copies per cell and thus are more easily accessible in ancient fossils. Another method to investigate relationship between two species is through DNA hybridization. Single-stranded DNA segments of both species are allowed to form complementary pair bonding with each other

. aDNA comparison study can also reveal the evolutionary relationship between two species. The number of base differences between DNA of an ancient species and that of a closely related extant species can be used to estimate the divergence time of those two species from their last common ancestor. The phylogeny of some extinct species, such as Australian marsupial wolves and American ground sloths, has been constructed by this method

. Comparing a given gene with that of other species enables geneticists to determine whether it is rapidly evolving in humans alone. For example, while human DNA is on average 98% identical to chimp DNA, the so-called Human Accelerated Region 1 (HAR1), involved in the development of the brain, is only 85% similar

Archaeogenetics has been used to study the d","According to the context, Mitochondrial DNA in animals and chloroplast DNA in plants are usually used for this purpose because they have hundreds of copies per cell and thus are more easily accessible in ancient fossils.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.0,"The answer provides a correct description of the commonly used DNA types for investigating relationships between two species, but it could be improved by providing more context or examples."
How strong was the ancient human-Neanderthal hybridization signal in the study by Scholz et al.?,Weak,". More closely related species have a more similar genetic makeup, and thus a stronger hybridization signal. Scholz et al. conducted southern blot hybridization on Neanderthal aDNA (extracted from fossil remain W-NW and Krapina). The results showed weak ancient human-Neanderthal hybridization and strong ancient human-modern human hybridization. The human-chimpanzee and Neanderthal-chimpanzee hybridization are of similarly weak strength

. Though East Asians inherit more Neanderthal DNA than Europeans, East Asians, South Asians, Australo-Melanesians, Native Americans, and Europeans all share Neanderthal DNA, so hybridization likely occurred between Neanderthals and their common ancestors coming out of Africa. Their differences also suggest separate hybridization events for the ancestors of East Asians and other Eurasians

. All these may have all contributed to modern Homo sapiens replacing Neanderthal populations by 28,000 BP. Earlier evidence from sequencing mitochondrial DNA suggested that no significant gene flow occurred between H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens, and that the two were separate species that shared a common ancestor about 660,000 years ago. However, a sequencing","According to the context, the answer is ""weak"". The text states that ""The results showed weak ancient human-Neanderthal hybridization...""",0.25,0.4,0.1,0.6,0.0,"The answer is not consistent with the ground truth, which suggests that the hybridization signal is weak."
How are humans and Neanderthals related in terms of their genetic diversity?,Not as closely related as two individuals of the same species are,". At present estimate, humans have approximately 20,000–25,000 genes and share 99% of their DNA with the now extinct Neanderthal and 95–99% of their DNA with their closest living evolutionary relative, the chimpanzees. The human variant of the FOXP2 gene (linked to the control of speech) has been found to be identical in Neanderthals. Divergence of Neanderthal and Denisovan lineages from a common ancestor

. The earliest analyses were of Neanderthal DNA, and indicated that the Neanderthal contribution to modern human genetic diversity was no more than 20%, with a most likely value of 0%. By 2010, however, detailed DNA sequencing of the Neanderthal specimens from Europe indicated that the contribution was nonzero, with Neanderthals sharing 1-4% more genetic variants with living non-Africans than with living humans in sub-Saharan Africa

. The flow of genes from Neanderthal populations to modern humans was not all one way. Sergi Castellano of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology reported in 2016 that while Denisovan and Neanderthal genomes are more related to each other than they are to us, Siberian Neanderthal genomes show more similarity to modern human genes than","According to the context, humans and Neanderthals share 99% of their DNA, indicating that they are closely related. The analysis also suggests that Neanderthals contributed a significant amount (1-4%) of genetic variants to modern human populations outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, it is noted that Siberian Neanderthal genomes show more similarity to modern human genes than Denisovan and Neanderthal genomes do to each other. This implies that there was a flow of genes from Neanderthals to modern humans, indicating a degree of interbreeding between the two species. Overall, humans and Neanderthals are related in terms of their genetic diversity through this shared genetic material and evidence of gene flow.",0.8,0.6,0.95,0.7,0.9,"The answer is somewhat correct, but it does not accurately reflect the difference in genetic diversity between humans and Neanderthals."
What is the similarity found between the aDNA sequence from Neanderthal Vi-80 fossil and modern human X chromosome sequence?,"2.18 bases per 10,000",". For example, Green et al. compared the aDNA sequence from Neanderthal Vi-80 fossil with modern human X and Y chromosome sequence, and they found a similarity in 2.18 and 1.62 bases per 10,000 respectively, suggesting Vi-80 sample was from a male individual. Other similar studies include finding of a mutation associated with dwarfism in Arabidopsis in ancient Nubian cotton, and investigation on the bitter taste perception locus in Neanderthals

. This suggests that humans and Neanderthals are not as closely related as two individuals of the same species are, but they are more related to each other than to chimpanzees. There have also been some attempts to decipher aDNA to provide valuable phenotypic information of ancient species.

How many males and females are thought to have left Africa in the earliest human population?,approximately 1500,". Modern humans are thought to have evolved in Africa at least 200 kya (thousand years ago), with some evidence suggesting a date of over 300 kya. Examination of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y-chromosome DNA, and X-chromosome DNA indicate that the earliest population to leave Africa consisted of approximately 1500 males and females

. It proposes that Homo sapiens evolved in Africa before migrating across the world."" And: ""The primary competing scientific hypothesis is currently recent African origin of modern humans, which proposes that modern humans arose as a new species in Africa around 100-200,000 years ago, moving out of Africa around 50-60,000 years ago to replace existing human species such as Homo erectus and the Neanderthals without interbreeding

.) It is believed that H. erectus and H. ergaster were the first to use fire and complex tools, and were the first of the hominin line to leave Africa, spreading throughout Africa, Asia, and Europe between 1.3 to 1.8 million years ago. According to the recent African origin theory, modern humans evolved in Africa possibly from H. heidelbergensis, H. rhodesiensis or H. antecessor and migrated out of the continent some 50,000 to 100","According to the context, approximately 1500 males and females are thought to have left Africa in the earliest human population.",1.0,0.7,0.8,0.5,1.0,"The answer provides a reasonable estimate of the number of individuals who left Africa in the early human population, but the context could provide more specific information or clarify the timeframe."
What was the number of populations studied in one research that suggested an ancient geographic structure to African populations?,121,". It has been suggested by various studies that populations were geographically “structured” to some degree prior to the expansion out of Africa; this is suggested by the antiquity of shared mtDNA lineages. One study of 121 populations from various places throughout the continent found 14 genetic and linguistic “clusters,” suggesting an ancient geographic structure to African populations

. A broad study of African genetic diversity, headed by Sarah Tishkoff, found the San people had the greatest genetic diversity among the 113 distinct populations sampled, making them one of 14 ""ancestral population clusters"". The research also located a possible origin of modern human migration in southwestern Africa, near the coastal border of Namibia and Angola

. Studies of the human genome using machine learning have identified additional genetic contributions in Eurasians from an ""unknown"" ancestral population potentially related to the Neanderthal-Denisovan lineage. There are still differing theories on whether there was a single exodus from Africa or several. A multiple dispersal model involves the Southern Dispersal theory, which has gained support in recent years from genetic, linguistic","According to the context, the answer is:

When did Bantu speakers migrate into Southern Africa?,approximately 5 kya,". 3900 BCE. The Bantu expansion has spread the Bantu languages to Central, Eastern and Southern Africa, partly replacing the indigenous populations of these regions, including the African Pygmies, Hadza people and San people. Beginning about 3,000 years ago, it reached South Africa about 1,700 years ago. Some evidence (including a 2016 study by Busby et al.) suggests admixture from ancient and recent migrations from Eurasia into parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. Another study (Ramsay et al

. In general, genotypic and phenotypic analysis have shown “large and subdivided throughout much of their evolutionary history.” Genetic analysis has supported archaeological hypotheses of a large-scale migrations of Bantu speakers into Southern Africa approximately 5 kya. Microsatellite DNA, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and insertion/deletion polymorphisms (INDELS) have shown that Nilo-Saharan speaking populations originate from Sudan

. These findings might give some support to the claim that modern humans from Africa arrived at southern China about 100,000 years ago (Zhiren Cave, Zhirendong, Chongzuo City: 100,000 years ago;[note 9] and the Liujiang hominid (Liujiang County): controvers","According to the text, genetic analysis has supported archaeological hypotheses of a large-scale migration of Bantu speakers into Southern Africa approximately 5 kya (thousand years ago).",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.9,"The LLM generated answer is factually correct, but it provides a broad timeframe (5 kya) rather than the specific date (3,000 BCE) mentioned in the context."
When did modern humans occupy Eurasia?,Between 60 and 70 kya,". They entered Eurasia by the Zagros Mountains (near present-day Iran and eastern Turkey) around 50,000 years ago, with one group rapidly settling coastal areas around the Indian Ocean and another migrating north to the steppes of Central Asia. Modern human remains dating to 45,000-47,000 have been found in Germany, while finds of 43,000–45,000 years ago have been discovered in Italy and Britain, as well as in the European Russian Arctic from 40,000 years ago

. This migration out of Africa is estimated to have begun about 70–50,000 years BP and modern humans subsequently spread globally, replacing earlier hominins either through competition or hybridization. They inhabited Eurasia and Oceania by 40,000 years BP, and the Americas by at least 14,500 years BP. The hypothesis of interbreeding, also known as hybridization, admixture or hybrid-origin theory, has been discussed ever since the discovery of Neanderthal remains in the 19th century

. Modern humans then repopulated Europe from the east after the eruption and the ice age that took place from 38,000 to 36,000 BCE.

The LLM's answer also suggests an occupation date of 40,000 years BP, which is much earlier than the accepted historical range."
"When did occupation of the Near East and Europe occur, according to genetic evidence?",50 kya,". Genetic evidence shows that occupation of the Near East and Europe happened no earlier than 50 kya. Studying haplogroup U has shown separate dispersals from the Near East both into Europe and into North Africa. Much of the work done in archaeogenetics focuses on the Neolithic transition in Europe. Cavalli-Svorza's analysis of genetic-geographic patterns led him to conclude that there was a massive influx of Near Eastern populations into Europe at the start of the Neolithic

. Furthermore, there is genetic evidence that Chad-speaking descendants of Nilo-Saharan speakers migrated from Sudan to Lake Chad about 8 kya. Genetic evidence has also indicated that non-African populations made significant contributions to the African gene pool. For example, the Saharan African Beja people have high levels of Middle-Eastern as well as East African Cushitic DNA. Analysis of mtDNA shows that modern humans occupied Eurasia in a single migratory event between 60 and 70 kya

What percentage of extant European mtDNAs did M.B. Richards estimate came from Near Eastern populations during the Neolithic?,10-22%,". This view led him “to strongly emphasize the expanding early farmers at the expense of the indigenous Mesolithic foraging populations.” mtDNA analysis in the 1990s, however, contradicted this view. M.B. Richards estimated that 10–22% of extant European mtDNA's had come from Near Eastern populations during the Neolithic. Most mtDNA's were “already established” among existing Mesolithic and Paleolithic groups

Modern humans then repopulated Europe from the east after the eruption and the ice age that took place from 38,000 to 36,000 BCE. A mitochondrial DNA sequence of two Cro-Magnons from the Paglicci Cave in Italy, dated to 23,000 and 24,000 years old (Paglicci 52 and 12), identified the mtDNA as Haplogroup N, typical of the latter group.

When did Austro-Asiatic speakers enter India?,about 45–60 kya,". Phylogenetic data suggests that an early Eastern Eurasian (Eastern non-African) meta-population trifurcated somewhere in eastern South Asia, and gave rise to the Australo-Papuans, the Ancient Ancestral South Indians (AASI), as well as East/Southeast Asians, although Papuans may have also received some gene flow from an earlier group (xOoA), around 2%, next to additional archaic admixture in the Sahul region

. From there, they further colonized Hawaii by 900 CE, Rapa Nui by 1000 CE, and New Zealand by 1200 CE. In the Indian Ocean, Austronesians from Borneo also colonized Madagascar and the Comoros Islands by around 500 CE. Austronesians remain the dominant ethnolinguistic group of the islands of the Indo-Pacific, and were the first to establish a maritime trade network reaching as far west as East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula

. A 2021 study about the population history of Eastern Eurasia, concluded that distinctive Basal-East Asian (East-Eurasian) ancestry originated in Mainland Southeast Asia at ~50,000BC from a distinct southern Himalayan route, and expanded through multiple migration waves southwards and northwards respectively

When did migrations from West Asia and Central Asia to India occur?,no earlier than 8 kya,". The Indian gene pool has contributions from earliest settlers, as well as West Asian and Central Asian populations from migrations no earlier than 8 kya. The lack of variation in mtDNA lineages compared to the Y-chromosome lineages indicate that primarily males partook in these migrations. The discovery of two subbranches U2i and U2e of the U mtDNA lineage, which arose in Central Asia has “modulated” views of a large migration from Central Asia into India, as the two branches diverged 50 kya

There were at least several ""out-of-Africa"" dispersals of modern humans, possibly beginning as early as 270,000 years ago, including 215,000 years ago to at least Greece, and certainly via northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula about 130,000 to 115,000 years ago. There is evidence that modern humans had reached China around 80,000 years ago

. Some research showing slower than expected genetic mutations in human DNA was published in 2012, indicating a revised dating for the migration to between 90,000 and 130,000 years ago.

What is a conclusion archaeologists have drawn about the origins of northeast Asian groups?,That they came from the southeast,". Much work has been done to discover the extent of north-to-south and south-to-north migrations within Eastern Asia. Comparing the genetic diversity of northeastern groups with southeastern groups has allowed archaeologists to conclude many of the northeast Asian groups came from the southeast

. A review paper by Melinda A. Yang (in 2022) summarized and concluded that a distinctive ""Basal-East Asian population"" referred to as 'East- and Southeast Asian lineage' (ESEA); which is ancestral to modern East Asians, Southeast Asians, Polynesians, and Siberians, originated in Mainland Southeast Asia at ~50,000BC, and expanded through multiple migration waves southwards and northwards respectively

. Genetic studies concluded that Native Americans descended from a single founding population that initially split from a Basal-East Asian source population in Mainland Southeast Asia around 36,000 years ago, at the same time at which the proper Jōmon people split from Basal-East Asians, either together with Ancestral Native Americans or during a separate expansion wave

What was found to be correlated with latitude in the Pan-Asian SNP study?,Haplotype diversity,". The Pan-Asian SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) study found “a strong and highly significant correlation between haplotype diversity and latitude,” which, when coupled with demographic analysis, supports the case for a primarily south-to-north occupation of East Asia. Archaeogenetics has also been used to study hunter-gatherer populations in the region, such as the Ainu from Japan and Negrito groups in the Philippines

For example, the Pan-Asian SNP study found that Negrito populations in Malaysia and the Negrito populations in the Philippines were more closely related to non-Negrito local populations than to each other, suggesting Negrito and non-Negrito populations are linked by one entry event into East Asia; although other Negrito groups do share affinities, including with Indigenous Australians. A possible explanation of this is a recent admixture of some Negrito groups with their local populations

. The Pan-Asian SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) study found “a strong and highly significant correlation between haplotype diversity and latitude,” which, when coupled with demographic analysis, supports the case for a primarily south-to-north occupation of East Asia. Archaeogenetics has also been used to study hunter-gatherer populations in the region, such as the Ainu from Japan and Negrito groups in the Philippines

What is the estimated age range for Native American mtDNA haplogroups?,15 and 20 kya,". Archaeogenetics has been used to better understand the populating of the Americas from Asia. Native American mtDNA haplogroups have been estimated to be between 15 and 20 kya, although there is some variation in these estimates. Genetic data has been used to propose various theories regarding how the Americas were colonized. Although the most widely held theory suggests “three waves” of migration after the LGM through the Bering Strait, genetic data have given rise to alternative hypotheses

. Based on an analysis of 55 human mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) of hunter-gatherers, Posth et al. (2016) argue for a ""rapid single dispersal of all non-Africans less than 55,000 years ago"". By 45,000 years ago, modern humans are known to have reached northwestern Europe. The first lineage to branch off from Mitochondrial Eve was L0. This haplogroup is found in high proportions among the San of Southern Africa and the Sandawe of East Africa. It is also found among the Mbuti people

. A Stanford University School of Medicine study was done by comparing Y-chromosome sequences and mtDNA in 69 men from different geographic regions and constructing a family tree. It was found that the Y-MRCA live","According to the context, the estimated age range for Native American mtDNA haplogroups is between 15 and 20 thousand years ago (kya).",0.95,0.9,0.85,0.8,0.0,"The LLM answer is mostly correct, but it could be improved by providing a more specific age range and by explaining the rationale behind the answer."
What is one possible migration path from which humans originated?,From Siberia to South America,".[note 1] The recent African origin theory suggests that the anatomically modern humans outside of Africa descend from a population of Homo sapiens migrating from East Africa roughly 70–50,000 years ago and spreading along the southern coast of Asia and to Oceania by about 50,000 years ago. Modern humans spread across Europe about 40,000 years ago

. As of 2010, there were two main accepted dispersal routes for the out-of-Africa migration of early anatomically modern humans, the ""Northern Route"" (via Nile Valley and Sinai) and the ""Southern Route"" via the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. Beginning 135,000 years ago, tropical Africa experienced megadroughts which drove humans from the land and towards the sea shores, and forced them to cross over to other continents

. It proposes that Homo sapiens evolved in Africa before migrating across the world."" And: ""The primary competing scientific hypothesis is currently recent African origin of modern humans, which proposes that modern humans arose as a new species in Africa around 100-200,000 years ago, moving out of Africa around 50-60,000 years ago to replace existing human species such as Homo erectus and the Neanderthals without interbreeding

.","According to the context, one possible migration path from which humans originated is the ""Southern Route"" via the Bab-el-Mandeb strait.",0.6,0.8,0.7,0.4,0.8,"The LLM correctly identifies the Southern Route as a possible migration path, but the context could provide more details and support for this answer."
What conclusion have some scientists reached about a southern migration into the Americas?,That it is impossible,".” Studying haplogroups has led some scientists to conclude that a southern migration into the Americas from one small population was impossible, although separate analysis has found that such a model is feasible if such a migration happened along the coasts. Finally, archaeogenetics has been used to study the occupation of Australia and New Guinea

. Studies of the human genome using machine learning have identified additional genetic contributions in Eurasians from an ""unknown"" ancestral population potentially related to the Neanderthal-Denisovan lineage. There are still differing theories on whether there was a single exodus from Africa or several. A multiple dispersal model involves the Southern Dispersal theory, which has gained support in recent years from genetic, linguistic and archaeological evidence

. For example, one hypothesis proposes a migration from Siberia to South America 20–15 kya and a second migration that occurred after glacial recession. Y-chromosome data has led some to hold that there was a single migration starting from the Altai Mountains of Siberia between 17.2 and 10.1 kya, after the LGM. Analysis of both mtDNA and Y-chromosome DNA reveals evidence of “","According to the context, some scientists have concluded that a southern migration into the Americas from one small population is impossible.",0.2,0.4,0.6,0.3,0.7,"The context mainly focuses on the analysis of haplogroups and archaeogenetics, which are not directly relevant to the question about southern migration.

What is a notable difference found in non-coding regions of mtDNA between Aboriginal populations of Australia and New Guinea?,There are 'no similarities' between them.,". The Indigenous people of Australia and New Guinea are phenotypically very similar, but mtDNA has shown that this is due to convergence from living in similar conditions. Non-coding regions of mt-DNA have shown “no similarities” between the aboriginal populations of Australia and New Guinea. Furthermore, no major NRY lineages are shared between the two populations

. Comparison of the mitochondrial DNA with that of ancient and modern aborigines, led to the conclusion that Mungo Man fell outside the range of genetic variation seen in Aboriginal Australians and was used to support the multiregional origin hypothesis. A reanalysis of LM3 and other ancient specimens from the area published in 2016, showed it to be akin to modern Aboriginal Australian sequences, inconsistent with the results of the earlier study

. The high frequency of a single NRY lineage unique to Australia coupled with “low diversity of lineage-associated Y-chromosomal short tandem repeat (Y-STR) haplotypes” provide evidence for a “recent founder or bottleneck” event in Australia.

What was affected primarily by the bottleneck effect according to the text?,Males,". For modern language to have occurred, PFC delay had to have an immense survival benefit in later life, such as PFS ability. This suggests that the mutation that caused PFC delay and the development of recursive language and PFS occurred simultaneously, which lines up with evidence of a genetic bottleneck around 70,000 years ago

. The high frequency of a single NRY lineage unique to Australia coupled with “low diversity of lineage-associated Y-chromosomal short tandem repeat (Y-STR) haplotypes” provide evidence for a “recent founder or bottleneck” event in Australia. But there is relatively large variation in mtDNA, which would imply that the bottleneck effect impacted males primarily

. Alternatively, a small European founder population that had expressed haplogroup M and N at first, could have lost haplogroup M through random genetic drift resulting from a bottleneck (i.e. a founder effect). The group that crossed the Red Sea travelled along the coastal route around Arabia and Persia until reaching India

"When did the splitting event between the two groups occur, according to NRY and mtDNA studies?",over 50 kya,". Together, NRY and mtDNA studies show that the splitting event between the two groups was over 50 kya, casting doubt on recent common ancestry between the two. Archaeogenetics has been used to understand the development of domestication of plants and animals. The combination of genetics and archeological findings have been used to trace the earliest signs of plant domestication around the world

. A Stanford University School of Medicine study was done by comparing Y-chromosome sequences and mtDNA in 69 men from different geographic regions and constructing a family tree. It was found that the Y-MRCA lived between 120,000 and 156,000, and the Mitochondrial Eve lived between 99,000 and 148,000 years ago, which not only predates some proposed waves of migration, but also meant that both lived in the African continent around the same time period

What type of DNA is used over mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA for tracing genealogy due to its faster mutation rate?,Nuclear DNA,". However, since the nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast genomes used to trace domestication's moment of origin have evolved at different rates, its use to trace genealogy have been somewhat problematic. Nuclear DNA in specific is used over mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA because of its faster mutation rate as well as its intraspecific variation due to a higher consistency of polymorphism genetic markers

. Mitochondrial DNA in animals and chloroplast DNA in plants are usually used for this purpose because they have hundreds of copies per cell and thus are more easily accessible in ancient fossils. Another method to investigate relationship between two species is through DNA hybridization. Single-stranded DNA segments of both species are allowed to form complementary pair bonding with each other

. To identify informative genetic markers for tracking human evolutionary history, Wilson concentrated on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is maternally inherited. This DNA material mutates quickly, making it easy to plot changes over relatively short times

What was the year when the Linguistic Society of Paris banned any existing or future debates on the topic of language?,1866,". The shortage of direct, empirical evidence has caused many scholars to regard the entire topic as unsuitable for serious study; in 1866, the Linguistic Society of Paris banned any existing or future debates on the subject, a prohibition which remained influential across much of the Western world until the late twentieth century.

When did Noam Chomsky propose the development of a common language faculty in humans?,"approximately 100,000 years ago",". Noam Chomsky, a proponent of discontinuity theory, argues that a single change occurred in humans before leaving Africa, coincident with the Great Leap approximately 100,000 years ago, in which a common language faculty developed in a group of humans and their descendants. Chomsky bases his argument on the observation that any human baby of any culture can be raised in a different culture and will completely assimilate the language and behavior of the new culture in which they were raised

. According to Steven Pinker, who builds on the work by Noam Chomsky, the universal human ability to learn to talk between the ages of 1 – 4, basically without training, suggests that language acquisition is a distinctly human psychological adaptation (see, in particular, Pinker's The Language Instinct)

. In particular, supporters of Noam Chomsky argue against the possibility that the mirror neuron system can play any role in the hierarchical recursive structures essential to syntax. According to Dean Falk's ""putting-down-the-baby"" theory, vocal interactions between early hominid mothers and infants began a sequence of events that led, eventually, to human ancestors' earliest words

What does the emergence of language imply about changes to the human language faculty?,No major change to the human language faculty has occurred since they left Africa.,". This implies that no major change to the human language faculty has occurred since they left Africa. Transcending the continuity-versus-discontinuity divide, some scholars view the emergence of language as the consequence of some kind of social transformation that, by generating unprecedented levels of public trust, liberated a genetic potential for linguistic creativity that had previously lain dormant. ""Ritual/speech coevolution theory"" exemplifies this approach

What is required for 'cheap signals' such as words to become an evolutionarily stable strategy?,A very specific social structure capable of upholding unusually high levels of public accountability and trust,". A very specific social structure – one capable of upholding unusually high levels of public accountability and trust – must have evolved before or concurrently with language to make reliance on ""cheap signals"" (e.g. words) an evolutionarily stable strategy. Since the emergence of language lies so far back in human prehistory, the relevant developments have left no direct historical traces, and comparable processes cannot be observed today

. A very specific social structure—one capable of upholding unusually high levels of public accountability and trust—must have evolved before or concurrently with language to make reliance on ""cheap signals"" (words) an evolutionarily stable strategy. The animistic nature of early human language could serve as the handicap-like cost that helped to ensure the reliability of communication

. This property prevents utterances from being corroborated in the immediate ""here"" and ""now"". For this reason, language presupposes relatively high levels of mutual trust in order to become established over time as an evolutionarily stable strategy. This stability is born of a longstanding mutual trust and is what grants language its authority.

What is an example of a language-relevant gene that may be found in early human fossils?,FOXP2,". Despite this, the emergence of new sign languages in modern times—Nicaraguan Sign Language, for example—may offer insights into the developmental stages and creative processes necessarily involved. Another approach inspects early human fossils, looking for traces of physical adaptation to language use. In some cases, when the DNA of extinct humans can be recovered, the presence or absence of genes considered to be language-relevant—FOXP2, for example—may prove informative

. Lacking direct linguistic evidence, specialists in human origins have resorted to the study of anatomical features and genes arguably associated with speech production. Whilst such studies may provide information as to whether pre-modern Homo species had speech capacities, it is still unknown whether they actually spoke. Whilst they may have communicated vocally, the anatomical and genetic data lack the resolution necessary to differentiate proto-language from speech

What is the estimated time range for the evolution of language or its anatomical prerequisites?,"50,000–150,000 years ago",". The time range for the evolution of language or its anatomical prerequisites extends, at least in principle, from the phylogenetic divergence of Homo from Pan to the emergence of full behavioral modernity some 50,000–150,000 years ago. Few dispute that Australopithecus probably lacked vocal communication significantly more sophisticated than that of great apes in general, but scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of Homo some 2.5 million years ago

Berwick and Chomsky therefore suggest language emerged approximately between 200,000 years ago and 60,000 years ago (between the appearance of the first anatomically modern humans in southern Africa and the last exodus from Africa respectively).

Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as Homo habilis, while others place the development of symbolic communication only with Homo erectus (1.8 million years ago) or with Homo heidelbergensis (0.6 million years ago) and the development of language proper with Homo sapiens, currently estimated at less than 200,000 years ago

When did linguist Johanna Nichols argue that vocal languages began diversifying in the human species?,"At least 100,000 years ago",". Using statistical methods to estimate the time required to achieve the current spread and diversity in modern languages, Johanna Nichols—a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley—argued in 1998 that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in the human species at least 100,000 years ago

. Using statistical methods to estimate the time required to achieve the current spread and diversity in modern languages today, Johanna Nichols – a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley – argued in 1998 that vocal languages must have begun diversifying at least 100,000 years ago. In 2012, anthropologists Charles Perreault and Sarah Mathew used phonemic diversity to suggest a date consistent with this

. Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as we know it emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of Homo sapiens.

Who published a list of speculative theories concerning the origins of spoken language in 1861?,Max Müller,". I cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man's own instinctive cries. In 1861, historical linguist Max Müller published a list of speculative theories concerning the origins of spoken language: Most scholars today consider all such theories not so much wrong—they occasionally offer peripheral insights—as naïve and irrelevant

. An increasingly systematic approach to historical linguistics developed in the course of the 19th century, reaching its culmination in the Neogrammarian school of Karl Brugmann and others. However, scholarly interest in the question of the origin of language has only gradually been revived from the 1950s on (and then controversially) with ideas such as universal grammar, mass comparison and glottochronology

. While Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection had provoked a surge of speculation on the origin of language over a century and a half ago, the speculations had not resulted in a scientific consensus by 1996.

What is the main obstacle to the evolution of language-like communication in nature from the perspective of signalling theory?,Not a mechanistic one,". The problem with these theories is that they rest on the assumption that once early humans had discovered a workable mechanism for linking sounds with meanings, language would automatically have evolved. Much earlier, medieval Muslim scholars developed theories on the origin of language. Their theories were of five general types: From the perspective of signalling theory, the main obstacle to the evolution of language-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one

. Oral and gestural languages consist of pattern-making whose cost is essentially zero. As pure social conventions, signals of this kind cannot evolve in a Darwinian social world—they are a theoretical impossibility

Language is ruled out because the best way to guard against being deceived is to ignore all signals except those that are instantly verifiable. Words automatically fail this test.

"According to the text, which of the following is an example of an intrinsically reliable animal vocal signal?",When a cat purrs,". The attribution of spiritual essence to everything surrounding early humans served as a built-in mechanism that provided instant verification and ensured the inviolability of one's speech. Animal vocal signals are, for the most part, intrinsically reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal's contented state. The signal is trusted, not because the cat is inclined to be honest, but because it just cannot fake that sound

. Rather, it is the fact that symbols—arbitrary associations of sounds or other perceptible forms with corresponding meanings—are unreliable and may as well be false. The problem of reliability was not recognized at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionary theorists. Animal vocal signals are, for the most part, intrinsically reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal's contented state

What is a characteristic of primate vocal calls?,They are hard to fake,". Primates are known to make ""vocal calls"", and these calls are generated by circuits in the brainstem and limbic system. In the wild, the communication of vervet monkeys has been the most extensively studied. They are known to make up to ten different vocalizations. Many of these are used to warn other members of the group about approaching predators. They include a ""leopard call"", a ""snake call"", and an ""eagle call""

. One notable finding is that nonhuman primates, including the other great apes, produce calls that are graded, as opposed to categorically differentiated, with listeners striving to evaluate subtle gradations in signallers' emotional and bodily states. Nonhuman apes seemingly find it extremely difficult to produce vocalisations in the absence of the corresponding emotional states

These results can be seen as evidence for the application of the ""open-ended generative property"" of language in human numeral cognition.

In the domain of the lexical-phonological principle, two features of this list are most important: The sound system of a language is composed of a finite set of simple phonological items

. Some scholars, such as Noam Chomsky, view language as an initially cognitive development, its ""externalisation"" to serve communicative purposes occurring later in human evolution. According to one such school of thought, the key feature distinguishing human language is recursion, (in this context, the iterative embedding of phrases within phrases). Other scholars—notably Daniel Everett—deny that recursion is universal, citing certain languages (e.g

This property prevents utterances from being corroborated in the immediate ""here"" and ""now"". For this reason, language presupposes relatively high levels of mutual trust in order to become established over time as an evolutionarily stable strategy.

Who proposed the 'mother tongues' hypothesis as a possible solution to a problem in 2004?,W. Tecumseh Fitch,". The ""mother tongues"" hypothesis was proposed in 2004 as a possible solution to this problem. W. Tecumseh Fitch suggested that the Darwinian principle of ""kin selection""—the convergence of genetic interests between relatives—might be part of the answer.

. If this is how grammar evolves today, according to this school of thought, similar principles at work can be legitimately inferred among distant human ancestors, when grammar itself was first being established. In order to reconstruct the evolutionary transition from early language to languages with complex grammars, it is necessary to know which hypothetical sequences are plausible and which are not

. It would also mean that the origin of language occurred at the same time as the emergence of symbolic culture. Numerous linguists have criticized Atkinson's paper as misrepresenting both the phonemic data and processes of linguistic change, as language complexity does not necessarily correspond to age, and of failing to take into account the borrowing of phonemes from neighbouring languages, as some Bantu langu","According to the given text, the initial context in which language evolved is among distant human ancestors when grammar itself was first being established.",0.8,0.9,0.7,0.6,0.8,"The LLM's answer is somewhat relevant but lacks the depth of understanding required to accurately reflect on the origin of language.

What aspect of the kin selection theory does critics argue needs further explanation?,The extension of the 'mother tongue' networks from close relatives to more distant relatives,". Critics of this theory point out that kin selection is not unique to humans. So even if one accepts Fitch's initial premises, the extension of the posited ""mother tongue"" networks from close relatives to more distant relatives remains unexplained

. As Dawkins points out in The Selfish Gene (Chapter 6) and The Extended Phenotype, this must be distinguished from the green-beard effect. Although it is generally true that humans tend to be more altruistic toward their kin than toward non-kin, the relevant proximate mechanisms that mediate this cooperation have been debated (see kin recognition), with some arguing that kin status is determined primarily via social and cultural factors (such as co-residence, maternal association of sibs, etc

. When faced with a trait that seems maladaptive, some sociobiologists try to determine how the trait actually increases genetic fitness (maybe through kin selection or by speculating about early evolutionary environments). Dual inheritance theorists, in contrast, will consider a variety of genetic and cultural processes in addition to natural selection on genes

Smith of the University of New Ha","According to the context, critics argue that the extension of the posited ""mother tongue"" networks from close relatives to more distant relatives remains unexplained.",0.7,0.8,0.6,0.5,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the relevant aspect of kin selection theory, but its answer is not as detailed or nuanced as the ground truth answer."
What is the reason Fitch gives for the human-infant relationship being different from other species?,The extended period of physical immaturity of human infants and the postnatal growth of the human brain,". Fitch argues, however, that the extended period of physical immaturity of human infants and the postnatal growth of the human brain give the human-infant relationship a different and more extended period of intergenerational dependency than that found in any other species. Ib Ulbæk invokes another standard Darwinian principle—""reciprocal altruism""—to explain the unusually high levels of intentional honesty necessary for language to evolve

. The basic idea is that evolving human mothers, unlike their counterparts in other primates, could not move around and forage with their infants clinging onto their backs. Loss of fur in the human case left infants with no means of clinging on. Frequently, therefore, mothers had to put their babies down. As a result, these babies needed to be reassured that they were not being abandoned

. Non-human primates habitually deliver their young on their own, but the same cannot be said for modern-day humans. Isolated birth appears to be rare and actively avoided cross-culturally, even if birthing methods may differ between said cultures. This is due to the fact that the narrowing of the hips and the change in the pelvic angle caused a discrepancy in","According to the context, Fitch argues that the extended period of physical immaturity of human infants and the postnatal growth of the human brain give the human-infant relationship a different and more extended period of intergenerational dependency than that found in any other species.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.8,0.0,"The LLM's answer provides a correct description of the extended period of physical immaturity of human infants and the postnatal growth of the human brain, but it does not explain why this relationship is different from other species."
What type of relationships does ordinary Darwinian reciprocal altruism typically establish?,Between frequently interacting individuals,". ""Reciprocal altruism"" can be expressed as the principle that if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. In linguistic terms, it would mean that if you speak truthfully to me, I'll speak truthfully to you. Ordinary Darwinian reciprocal altruism, Ulbæk points out, is a relationship established between frequently interacting individuals

. Fitch argues, however, that the extended period of physical immaturity of human infants and the postnatal growth of the human brain give the human-infant relationship a different and more extended period of intergenerational dependency than that found in any other species. Ib Ulbæk invokes another standard Darwinian principle—""reciprocal altruism""—to explain the unusually high levels of intentional honesty necessary for language to evolve

. Evolutionary psychology also recognizes the role of kin selection and reciprocity in evolving prosocial traits such as altruism. Like chimpanzees and bonobos, humans have subtle and flexible social instincts, allowing them to form extended families, lifelong friendships, and political alliances

What is the condition for language to prevail across an entire community according to Ulbæk's theory?,Universal enforcement of reciprocity,". For language to prevail across an entire community, however, the necessary reciprocity would have needed to be enforced universally instead of being left to individual choice. Ulbæk concludes that for language to evolve, society as a whole must have been subject to moral regulation. Critics point out that this theory fails to explain when, how, why or by whom ""obligatory reciprocal altruism"" could possibly have been enforced. Various proposals have been offered to remedy this defect

. Being intrinsically unreliable, language works only if one can build up a reputation for trustworthiness within a certain kind of society—namely, one where symbolic cultural facts (sometimes called ""institutional facts"") can be established and maintained through collective social endorsement. In any hunter-gatherer society, the basic mechanism for establishing trust in symbolic cultural facts is collective ritual

Do humans typically withhold information until receiving valuable feedback from others?,false,". A further criticism is that language does not work on the basis of reciprocal altruism anyway. Humans in conversational groups do not withhold information to all except listeners likely to offer valuable information in return. On the contrary, they seem to want to advertise to the world their access to socially relevant information, broadcasting that information without expectation of reciprocity to anyone who will listen

. Natural selection favors strategies that base the decision to help on the reputation of the recipient: studies show that people who are more helpful are more likely to receive help. The calculations of indirect reciprocity are complicated and only a tiny fraction of this universe has been uncovered, but again a simple rule has emerged

. This book presents the now-standard mathematical models of the evolution of social learning under different environmental conditions, the population effects of social learning, various forces of selection on cultural learning rules, different forms of biased transmission and their population-level effects, and conflicts between cultural and genetic evolution.

"What is the primary function of gossip in human social dynamics, according to Robin Dunbar's book?",It allows individuals to service their relationships and maintain their alliances.,". Gossip, according to Robin Dunbar in his book Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language, language does for group-living humans what manual grooming does for other primates—it allows individuals to service their relationships and so maintain their alliances on the basis of the principle: if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours

. Vocal grooming then evolved gradually into vocal language—initially in the form of ""gossip"". Dunbar's hypothesis seems to be supported by adaptations, in the structure of language, to the function of narration in general. Critics of this theory point out that the efficiency of ""vocal grooming""—the fact that words are so cheap—would have undermined its capacity to signal commitment of the kind conveyed by time-consuming and costly manual grooming

. The fundamental importance of animal social skills lies within the ability to manage relationships and in turn, the ability to not just commit information to memory, but manipulate it as well. An adaptive response to the challenges of social interaction and living is theory of mind. Theory of mind as defined by Martin Brüne, is the ability to infer another individual's mental states or emotions. Having ","According to Robin Dunbar's book ""Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language"", the primary function of gossip is to service relationships and maintain alliances between individuals based on the principle: ""if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"".",0.7,0.8,0.9,0.6,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the main function of gossip as facilitating relationships and maintaining alliances based on reciprocity, but it could provide more nuanced and context-specific examples."
What did humans develop in response to the time-consuming task of manual grooming in large social groups?,Vocal grooming,". Dunbar argues that as humans began living in increasingly larger social groups, the task of manually grooming all one's friends and acquaintances became so time-consuming as to be unaffordable. In response to this problem, humans developed ""a cheap and ultra-efficient form of grooming""—vocal grooming. To keep allies happy, one now needs only to ""groom"" them with low-cost vocal sounds, servicing multiple allies simultaneously while keeping both hands free for other tasks

. Gossip, according to Robin Dunbar in his book Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language, language does for group-living humans what manual grooming does for other primates—it allows individuals to service their relationships and so maintain their alliances on the basis of the principle: if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours

. Vocal grooming then evolved gradually into vocal language—initially in the form of ""gossip"". Dunbar's hypothesis seems to be supported by adaptations, in the structure of language, to the function of narration in general. Critics of this theory point out that the efficiency of ""vocal grooming""—the fact that words are so cheap—would have undermined its capacity to signal commitme","According to the context, humans developed ""a cheap and ultra-efficient form of grooming"" - vocal grooming.

What is one criticism of Dunbar's hypothesis on the evolution of language?,The efficiency of vocal grooming would undermine its capacity to signal commitment,". He argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system. A similar argument is made by Terrence Deacon who in The Symbolic Species argues that the different features of language have co-evolved with the evolution of the mind and that the ability to use symbolic communication is integrated in all other cognitive processes

. Another criticism has questioned the logic of the argument for single mutation and puts forward that from the formal simplicity of Merge, the capacity Berwick and Chomsky deem the core property of human language that emerged suddenly, one cannot derive the (number of) evolutionary steps that led to it

It should also mention that Dunbar's hypothesis is not the only possible explanation for the evolution of language, and that other factors such as social learning and cognitive flexibility may also play a role."
Who proposed the original idea of the ritual/speech coevolution theory?,Roy Rappaport,". A further criticism is that the theory does nothing to explain the crucial transition from vocal grooming—the production of pleasing but meaningless sounds—to the cognitive complexities of syntactical speech. The ritual/speech coevolution theory was originally proposed by social anthropologist Roy Rappaport before being elaborated by anthropologists such as Chris Knight, Jerome Lewis, Nick Enfield, Camilla Power and Ian Watts

. Transcending the continuity-versus-discontinuity divide, some scholars view the emergence of language as the consequence of some kind of social transformation that, by generating unprecedented levels of public trust, liberated a genetic potential for linguistic creativity that had previously lain dormant.

. This implies that no major change to the human language faculty has occurred since they left Africa.

"What do Luc Steels, Terrence Deacon, and Cedric Boeckx argue about the origins of language?",That there can be no theory of the origins of language,". Cognitive scientist and robotics engineer Luc Steels is another prominent supporter of this general approach, as is biological anthropologist and neuroscientist Terrence Deacon. A more recent champion of the approach is the Chomskyan specialist in linguistic syntax, Cedric Boeckx. These scholars argue that there can be no such thing as a ""theory of the origins of language""

. Therefore, the task facing researchers into the origins of language is more multidisciplinary than is usually supposed. It involves addressing the evolutionary emergence of human ritual, kinship, religion and symbolic culture taken as a whole, with language an important but subsidiary component. In a 2023 article, Cedric Boeckx endorses the Rappaport/Searle/Knight way of capturing the ""special"" nature of human words. Words are symbols

. He argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system.

What is the wider domain that language is considered an internal aspect of?,human symbolic culture,". This is because language is not a separate adaptation, but an internal aspect of something much wider—namely, the entire domain known to anthropologists as human symbolic culture. Attempts to explain language independently of this wider context have failed, say these scientists, because they are addressing a problem with no solution. Language would not work outside its necessary environment of confidence-building social mechanisms and institutions

. Some scholars, such as Noam Chomsky, view language as an initially cognitive development, its ""externalisation"" to serve communicative purposes occurring later in human evolution. According to one such school of thought, the key feature distinguishing human language is recursion, (in this context, the iterative embedding of phrases within phrases). Other scholars—notably Daniel Everett—deny that recursion is universal, citing certain languages (e.g

As Bernd Heine and Tania Kuteva acknowledge: ""Grammaticalisation requires a linguistic system that is used regularly and frequently within a community of speakers and is passed on from one group of speakers to another"".

What is required for language to work according to the author?,The establishment of 'The Word' through the invariance of liturgy,". Being intrinsically unreliable, language works only if one can build up a reputation for trustworthiness within a certain kind of society—namely, one where symbolic cultural facts (sometimes called ""institutional facts"") can be established and maintained through collective social endorsement.

What do advocates of this school of thought claim is the problem with nonhuman apes using words in the wild?,That the words would carry no conviction,". Advocates of this school of thought point out that words are cheap. Should an especially clever nonhuman ape, or even a group of articulate nonhuman apes, try to use words in the wild, they would carry no conviction. The primate vocalizations that do carry conviction—those they actually use—are unlike words, in that they are emotionally expressive, intrinsically meaningful, and reliable because they are relatively costly and hard to fake

I have therefore argued that if there are to be words at all it is necessary to establish The Word, and that The Word is established by the invariance of liturgy

Can oral and gestural languages evolve in a Darwinian social world?,No,". Oral and gestural languages consist of pattern-making whose cost is essentially zero. As pure social conventions, signals of this kind cannot evolve in a Darwinian social world—they are a theoretical impossibility

. Evolutionary speaking, there is great evidence suggesting a genetic groundwork for the concept of languages has been in place for millions of years, as with many other capabilities and behaviours observed today. While evolutionary linguists agree on the fact that volitional control over vocalizing and expressing language is a quite recent leap in the history of the human race, that is not to say auditory perception is a recent development as well

. This property prevents utterances from being corroborated in the immediate ""here"" and ""now"". For this reason, language presupposes relatively high levels of mutual trust in order to become established over time as an evolutionarily stable strategy. This stability is born of a longstanding mutual trust and is what grants language its authority. A theory of ","According to the context, the primary mechanism for establishing trust in symbolic cultural facts in a hunter-gatherer society is collective ritual.",1.0,1.0,0.9,1.0,1.0,"The context clearly describes the primary mechanism as collective ritual, which is a well-established and widely accepted explanation for the establishment of trust in symbolic cultural facts in a hunter-gatherer society."
What is the main task facing researchers into the origins of language?,"Addressing the evolutionary emergence of human ritual, kinship, religion and symbolic culture taken as a whole",". Scholars wishing to study the origins of language draw inferences from evidence such as the fossil record, archaeological evidence, and contemporary language diversity. They may also study language acquisition as well as comparisons between human language and systems of animal communication (particularly other primates)

. Therefore, the task facing researchers into the origins of language is more multidisciplinary than is usually supposed. It involves addressing the evolutionary emergence of human ritual, kinship, religion and symbolic culture taken as a whole, with language an important but subsidiary component. In a 2023 article, Cedric Boeckx endorses the Rappaport/Searle/Knight way of capturing the ""special"" nature of human words. Words are symbols

. The ""origin of language"" as a subject in its own right emerged from studies in neurolinguistics, psycholinguistics and human evolution. The Linguistic Bibliography introduced ""Origin of language"" as a separate heading in 1988, as a sub-topic of psycholinguistics. Dedicated research institutes of evolutionary linguistics are a recent phenomenon, emerging only in the 1990s

"According to Darwinian signal evolution theory, what kind of signals are words?",Patently false signals,". Words are symbols. This means that, from a standpoint in Darwinian signal evolution theory, they are ""patently false signals."" Words are facts, but ""facts whose existence depends entirely on subjective belief""

. The problem with these theories is that they rest on the assumption that once early humans had discovered a workable mechanism for linking sounds with meanings, language would automatically have evolved. Much earlier, medieval Muslim scholars developed theories on the origin of language. Their theories were of five general types: From the perspective of signalling theory, the main obstacle to the evolution of language-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one

. Rather, it is the fact that symbols—arbitrary associations of sounds or other perceptible forms with corresponding meanings—are unreliable and may as well be false. The problem of reliability was not recognized at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionary theorists. Animal vocal signals are, for the most part, intrinsically reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal's contented state

What type of facts are linguistic utterances according to Boeckx?,Institutional facts,". In philosophical terms, they are ""institutional facts"": fictions that are granted factual status within human social institutions From this standpoint, according to Boeckx, linguistic utterances are symbolic to the extent that they are patent falsehoods serving as guides to communicative intentions. ""They are communicatively useful untruths, as it were."" The reason why words can survive among humans despite being false is largely down to a matter of trust

. Words are symbols. This means that, from a standpoint in Darwinian signal evolution theory, they are ""patently false signals."" Words are facts, but ""facts whose existence depends entirely on subjective belief""

. Lacking direct linguistic evidence, specialists in human origins have resorted to the study of anatomical features and genes arguably associated with speech production. Whilst such studies may provide information as to whether pre-modern Homo species had speech capacities, it is still unknown whether they actually spoke. Whilst they may have communicated vocally, the anatomical and genetic data lack the resolution necessary to differentiate proto-language from speech

What type of communication would the signaler focus on under social conditions where trust is taken for granted?,Digital signaling,". That is, in order to be taken seriously, each signal it emits must be a patently reliable one, trusted because it is rooted in some way in the real world. But now imagine what might happen under social conditions where trust could be taken for granted. The signaller could stop worrying about reliability and concentrate instead on perceptual discriminability. Carried to its conclusion, this should permit digital signaling—the cheapest and most efficient kind of communication

A very specific social structure—one capable of upholding unusually high levels of public accountability and trust—must have evolved before or concurrently with language to make reliance on ""cheap signals"" (words) an evolutionarily stable strategy.

What is the primary reason why animal communication cannot be digital?,Because it does not have the luxury of being patently false.,". From this philosophical standpoint, animal communication cannot be digital because it does not have the luxury of being patently false. Costly signals of any kind can only be evaluated on an analog scale. Put differently, truly symbolic, digital signals become socially acceptable only under highly unusual conditions—such as those internal to a ritually bonded community whose members are not tempted to lie

. For example, no vocally-impaired whale, dolphin, or songbird could express its song repertoire equally in visual display. Indeed, in the case of animal communication, message and modality are not capable of being disentangled. Whatever message is being conveyed stems from the intrinsic properties of the signal. Modality independence should not be confused with the ordinary phenomenon of multimodality

. Nothing about a chimpanzee's vocal apparatus suggests a digital keyboard[clarification needed], notwithstanding the anatomical and physiological similarities. This poses the question as to when and how, during the course of human evolution, the transition from analog to digital structure and function occurred

What is the term used by Noam Chomsky to describe the speech/ritual co-evolution idea theory?,The 'non-existence' hypothesis,". Critics of the speech/ritual co-evolution idea theory include Noam Chomsky, who terms it the ""non-existence"" hypothesis—a denial of the very existence of language as an object of study for natural science. Chomsky's own theory is that language emerged in an instant and in perfect form, prompting his critics in turn, to retort that only something that does not exist—a theoretical construct or convenient scientific fiction—could possibly emerge in such a miraculous way

""Ritual/speech coevolution theory"" exemplifies this approach

. Noam Chomsky, a proponent of discontinuity theory, argues that a single change occurred in humans before leaving Africa, coincident with the Great Leap approximately 100,000 years ago, in which a common language faculty developed in a group of humans and their descendants.

When did Acheulean tool use begin?,approximately 1.75 million years ago,". The controversy remains unresolved. Acheulean tool use began during the Lower Paleolithic approximately 1.75 million years ago. Studies focusing on the lateralization of Acheulean tool production and language production have noted similar areas of blood flow when engaging in these activities separately; this theory suggests that the brain functions needed for the production of tools across generations is consistent with the brain systems required for producing language

. Dated to around 3.3 million years ago, the implements are some 700,000 years older than stone tools from Ethiopia that previously held this distinction. The period from 700,000 to 300,000 years ago is also known as the Acheulean, when H. ergaster (or erectus) made large stone hand axes out of flint and quartzite, at first quite rough (Early Acheulian), later ""retouched"" by additional, more-subtle strikes at the sides of the flakes

. Stone tools are first attested around 2.6 million years ago, when hominins in Eastern Africa used so-called core tools, choppers made out of round cores that had been split by simple strikes.

What type of ultrasonography did researchers use to test participants?,functional transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (fTDC),". Researchers used functional transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (fTDC) and had participants perform activities related to the creation of tools using the same methods during the Lower Paleolithic as well as a task designed specifically for word generation. The purpose of this test was to focus on the planning aspect of Acheulean tool making and cued word generation in language (an example of cued word generation would be trying to list all words beginning with a given letter)

. Evolutionary psychologists also use various sources of data for testing, including experiments, archaeological records, data from hunter-gatherer societies, observational studies, neuroscience data, self-reports and surveys, public records, and human products. Recently, additional methods and tools have been introduced based on fictional scenarios, mathematical models, and multi-agent computer simulations

"According to Antoine Arnauld's Port-Royal Grammar, what motivated people to create language?",Their social and rational nature,". Renaissance philosopher Antoine Arnauld gave a detailed description of his idea of the origin of language in Port-Royal Grammar. According to Arnauld, people are social and rational by nature, and this urged them to create language as a means to communicate their ideas to others. Language construction would have occurred through a slow and gradual process. In later theory, especially in functional linguistics, the primacy of communication is emphasised over psychological needs

. I cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man's own instinctive cries. In 1861, historical linguist Max Müller published a list of speculative theories concerning the origins of spoken language: Most scholars today consider all such theories not so much wrong—they occasionally offer peripheral insights—as naïve and irrelevant

What was Ferdinand de Saussure's conclusion about evolutionary linguistics?,That it would not be able to provide any further revolutionary insight after the completion of major works in historical linguistics,". Saussure was particularly sceptical of the attempts of August Schleicher and other Darwinian linguists to access prehistorical languages through series of reconstructions of proto-languages. Saussure's solution to the problem of language evolution involves dividing theoretical linguistics in two. Evolutionary and historical linguistics are renamed as diachronic linguistics

. The exact way language evolved is however not considered as vital to the study of languages.

What was Saussure's proposed solution to the problem of language evolution?,Dividing theoretical linguistics into diachronic linguistics,". Saussure was particularly sceptical of the attempts of August Schleicher and other Darwinian linguists to access prehistorical languages through series of reconstructions of proto-languages. Saussure's solution to the problem of language evolution involves dividing theoretical linguistics in two. Evolutionary and historical linguistics are renamed as diachronic linguistics

. The exact way language evolved is however not considered as vital to the study of languages. Structural linguist Ferdinand de Saussure abandoned evolutionary linguistics after having come to the firm conclusion that it would not be able to provide any further revolutionary insight after the completion of the major works in historical linguistics by the end of the 19th century

. The ""mother tongues"" hypothesis was proposed in 2004 as a possible solution to this problem. W. Tecumseh Fitch suggested that the Darwinian principle of ""kin selection""—the convergence of genetic interests between relatives—might be part of the answer. Fitch suggests that languages were originally ""mother tongues""

What is the primary focus of synchronic linguistics?,A study of a given contemporary or historical language stage as a system in its own right,". It is the study of language change, but it has only limited explanatory power due to the inadequacy of all of the reliable research material that could ever be made available. Synchronic linguistics, in contrast, aims to widen scientists' understanding of language through a study of a given contemporary or historical language stage as a system in its own right

Who introduced structuralism to sociology?,Émile Durkheim,". Structuralism, as first introduced to sociology by Émile Durkheim, is nonetheless a type of humanistic evolutionary theory which explains diversification as necessitated by growing complexity. There was a shift of focus to functional explanation after Saussure's death.

"According to Chomsky's single-mutation theory, when did language emerge within the history of human evolution?",suddenly,". According to Chomsky's single-mutation theory, the emergence of language resembled the formation of a crystal; with digital infinity as the seed crystal in a super-saturated primate brain, on the verge of blossoming into the human mind, by physical law, once evolution added a single small but crucial keystone. Thus, in this theory, language appeared rather suddenly within the history of human evolution. Chomsky, writing with computational linguist and computer scientist Robert C

Is the scenario described in Berwick's text a common occurrence in modern biology?,true,". Berwick, suggests that this scenario is completely compatible with modern biology

. Nielsen et al. (2005a)’s estimate that 9.8% of genes have undergone adaptive evolution also has a large margin of error associated with it, and their estimate shrinks dramatically to 0.4% when they stipulate that the degree of certainty that there has been adaptive evolution must be 95% or more. This raises an important issue, which is that many of these tests for adaptive evolution are very weak

. One example is the evolutionary psychology model of extended social groups selecting for modern human brains, a contradiction being that the synaptic function of modern human brains require high amounts of many specific essential nutrients so that such a transition to higher requirements of the same essential nutrients being shared by all individuals in a population would decrease the possibility of forming large groups due to bottleneck foods with rare essential nutrients capping group sizes

What is a key concept missing from recent accounts of human language evolution?,The fully stochastic modern version,". The time range for the evolution of language or its anatomical prerequisites extends, at least in principle, from the phylogenetic divergence of Homo from Pan to the emergence of full behavioral modernity some 50,000–150,000 years ago. Few dispute that Australopithecus probably lacked vocal communication significantly more sophisticated than that of great apes in general, but scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of Homo some 2.5 million years ago

. Evolutionary speaking, there is great evidence suggesting a genetic groundwork for the concept of languages has been in place for millions of years, as with many other capabilities and behaviours observed today. While evolutionary linguists agree on the fact that volitional control over vocalizing and expressing language is a quite recent leap in the history of the human race, that is not to say auditory perception is a recent development as well

What is one topic that recent books on the evolution of language do not thoroughly explore?,Evolutionary outcomes affected by genetic or individual innovations,". While Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection had provoked a surge of speculation on the origin of language over a century and a half ago, the speculations had not resulted in a scientific consensus by 1996. Despite this, academic interest had returned to the topic by the early 1990s. Linguists, archaeologists, psychologists, and anthropologists have renewed the investigation into the origin of language with modern methods

... All this can affect evolutionary outcomes—outcomes that as far as we can make out are not brought out in recent books on the evolution of language, yet would arise immediately in the case of any new genetic or individual innovation, precisely the kind of scenario likely to be in play when talking about language's emergence

. The ""origin of language"" as a subject in its own right emerged from studies in neurolinguistics, psycholinguistics and human evolution. The Linguistic Bibliography introduced ""Origin of language"" as a separate heading in 1988, as a sub-topic of psycholinguistics.

Is it likely for a mutation with a significant fitness effect to take place and become fixed in a species?,No,". A formal analysis of the probability of such a mutation taking place and going to fixation in the species has concluded that such a scenario is unlikely, with multiple mutations with more moderate fitness effects being more probable

What is an example of a structure that can be nested within itself?,A sentence,". Thus, by nesting a structure such as a sentence or a word within themselves, it enables the generation of potentially (countably) infinite new variations of that structure. For example, the base sentence [Peter likes apples.] can be nested in irrealis clauses to produce [Mary said [Peter likes apples.]], [Paul believed [Mary said [Peter likes apples.]]] and so forth

. In colloquial terms, self-organisation is roughly captured by the idea of ""bottom-up"" (as opposed to ""top-down"") organisation. Examples of self-organised systems range from ice crystals to galaxy spirals in the inorganic world. According to many phoneticians, the sounds of language arrange and re-arrange themselves through self-organisation. Speech sounds have both perceptual (how one hears them) and articulatory (how one produces them) properties, all with continuous values

. In order to convey abstract ideas, the first recourse of speakers is to fall back on immediately recognizable concrete imagery, very often deploying metaphors rooted in shared bodily experience.

Using statistical methods to estimate the time required to achieve the current spread and diversity in modern languages today, Johanna Nichols – a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley – argued in 1998 that vocal languages must have begun diversifying at least 100,000 years ago. In 2012, anthropologists Charles Perreault and Sarah Mathew used phonemic diversity to suggest a date consistent with this

What is necessary for early hominins to develop recursive language?,Mental stimulation and recursive elements already in their language,". Then, the second phase was a rapid Chomskian single step, consisting of three distinct events that happened in quick succession around 70,000 years ago and allowed the shift from non-recursive to recursive language in early hominins. It is not enough for children to have a modern prefrontal cortex (PFC) to allow the development of PFS; the children must also be mentally stimulated and have recursive elements already in their language to acquire PFS

. In particular, supporters of Noam Chomsky argue against the possibility that the mirror neuron system can play any role in the hierarchical recursive structures essential to syntax. According to Dean Falk's ""putting-down-the-baby"" theory, vocal interactions between early hominid mothers and infants began a sequence of events that led, eventually, to human ancestors' earliest words

. Recent language theories present recursion as the unique facet of human language and theory of mind. However, breaking down language into its symbolic parts: separating meaning from the requirements of grammar, it becomes possible to see that language does not depend on either recursion or grammar. This can be evidenced by the Pirahã language users in B","According to the context, what is necessary for early hominins to develop recursive language is:

What is the process called when children invent new words or concepts that their parents would not have known yet?,Cryptophasia,". Since their parents would not have invented these elements yet, the children would have had to do it themselves, which is a common occurrence among young children that live together, in a process called cryptophasia. This means that delayed PFC development would have allowed more time to acquire PFS and develop recursive elements. Delayed PFC development also comes with negative consequences, such as a longer period of reliance on one's parents to survive and lower survival rates

. Rates of vocabulary expansion link to the ability of children to vocally mirror non-words and so to acquire the new word pronunciations. Such speech repetition occurs automatically, quickly and separately in the brain to speech perception. Moreover, such vocal imitation can occur without comprehension such as in speech shadowing and echolalia

. For example, novel technologies make it necessary for people to invent new words, but these may lose their function and be forgotten as the technologies are eventually replaced by more modern ones

. At first, children learned the calls (phonemes) from their parents by imitating their lip-movements (illustration part 5).

When did a genetic bottleneck occur?,"around 70,000 years ago",". For modern language to have occurred, PFC delay had to have an immense survival benefit in later life, such as PFS ability. This suggests that the mutation that caused PFC delay and the development of recursive language and PFS occurred simultaneously, which lines up with evidence of a genetic bottleneck around 70,000 years ago

. The high frequency of a single NRY lineage unique to Australia coupled with “low diversity of lineage-associated Y-chromosomal short tandem repeat (Y-STR) haplotypes” provide evidence for a “recent founder or bottleneck” event in Australia.

What is one theory about how human language developed?,The gestural theory,". Attempts to explain the origin of language take a variety of forms: Most linguistic scholars as of 2024[update] favor continuity-based theories, but they vary in how they hypothesize language development. Some among those who consider language as mostly innate avoid speculating about specific precursors in nonhuman primates, stressing simply that the language faculty must have evolved gradually

. The problem with these theories is that they rest on the assumption that once early humans had discovered a workable mechanism for linking sounds with meanings, language would automatically have evolved. Much earlier, medieval Muslim scholars developed theories on the origin of language. Their theories were of five general types: From the perspective of signalling theory, the main obstacle to the evolution of language-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one

Humans spontaneously use hand and facial gestures when formulating ideas to be conveyed in speech

. Only in humans (in the left hemisphere) is it also responsible for other processes associated with language use and acquisition, such as speech repetition and production, integration of phonemes with their lip movements, perception and production of intonations, phonological long-term memory (long-term memory storage of the sounds of words), and phonological working memory (the temporary storage of the sounds of words).

What is a characteristic gesture exhibited by gorillas?,Beating their breasts,". Primate gesture is at least partially genetic: different nonhuman apes will perform gestures characteristic of their species, even if they have never seen another ape perform that gesture. For example, gorillas beat their breasts. This shows that gestures are an intrinsic and important part of primate communication, which supports the idea that language evolved from gesture. Further evidence suggests that gesture and language are linked

. Monkeys and apes rely on a repertoire of species-specific ""gesture-calls"" – emotionally-expressive vocalisations inseparable from the visual displays which accompany them. Humans also have species-specific gesture-calls – laughs, cries, sobs, etc. – together with involuntary gestures accompanying speech. Many animal displays are polymodal in that each appears designed to exploit multiple channels simultaneously

Do humans gesture with their mouths when performing fine motor tasks?,Yes,". In humans, manually gesturing has an effect on concurrent vocalizations, thus creating certain natural vocal associations of manual efforts. Chimpanzees move their mouths when performing fine motor tasks. These mechanisms may have played an evolutionary role in enabling the development of intentional vocal communication as a supplement to gestural communication. Voice modulation could have been prompted by preexisting manual actions. From infancy, gestures both supplement and predict speech

. The fine motor movements associated with the tongue and the airway, make humans more capable of producing a wide range of intricate shapes in order to produce sounds at different rates and intensities. In humans, the lips are important for the production of stops and fricatives, in addition to vowels. Nothing, however, suggests that the lips evolved for those reasons

It could be more accurate to consider the context of the sentence and the evolutionary significance of the gesture in humans.
What was the initial purpose of gestures in human communication?,A sole means of communication,". This addresses the idea that gestures quickly change in humans from a sole means of communication (from a very young age) to a supplemental and predictive behavior that is used despite the ability to communicate verbally. This too serves as a parallel to the idea that gestures developed first and language subsequently built upon it

There are also a great number of sign languages still in existence, commonly associated with Deaf communities

. This could have been the result of a few individuals who developed PFS and recursive language which gave them significant competitive advantage over all other humans at the time. The gestural theory states that human language developed from gestures that were used for simple communication.

What is the location of the brain center controlling calls in monkeys and other animals compared to humans?,completely different,". In monkeys, this centre is located in the depths of the brain related to emotions. In the human system, it is located in an area unrelated to emotion. Humans can communicate simply to communicate—without emotions. So, anatomically, this scenario does not work. This suggests that language was derived from gesture(humans communicated by gesture first and sound was attached later). The important question for gestural theories is why there was a shift to vocalization

. Primates are known to make ""vocal calls"", and these calls are generated by circuits in the brainstem and limbic system. In the wild, the communication of vervet monkeys has been the most extensively studied. They are known to make up to ten different vocalizations. Many of these are used to warn other members of the group about approaching predators. They include a ""leopard call"", a ""snake call"", and an ""eagle call""

What is the main difference between sign languages and oral languages?,"The 'phonemes' are produced on the outside of the body, articulated with hands, body, and facial expression, rather than inside the body articulated with tongue, teeth, lips, and breathing.",". There are also, of course, many sign languages in existence, commonly associated with deaf communities; as noted above, these are equal in complexity, sophistication, and expressive power, to any oral language. The main difference is that the ""phonemes"" are produced on the outside of the body, articulated with hands, body, and facial expression, rather than inside the body articulated with tongue, teeth, lips, and breathing

What type of vocal communication was initially present in primates?,Pitch-based,". Many attempts have been made to explain scientifically how speech emerged in humans, although to date no theory has generated agreement. Non-human primates, like many other animals, have evolved specialized mechanisms for producing sounds for purposes of social communication. On the other hand, no monkey or ape uses its tongue for such purposes

Is primate vocal communication capable of being controlled consciously?,No,". However, Michael Corballis has pointed out that it is supposed that primate vocal communication (such as alarm calls) cannot be controlled consciously, unlike hand movement, and thus it is not credible as precursor to human language; primate vocalization is rather homologous to and continued in involuntary reflexes (connected with basic human emotions) such as screams or laughter (the fact that these can be faked does not disprove the fact that genuine involuntary responses to fear or surprise

What type of responses are mentioned in the context?,Involuntary responses,"."" Context biases result from individuals using clues about the social structure of their population to determine what cultural variants to adopt. This determination is made without reference to the content of the variant. There are two major categories of context biases: model-based biases, and frequency-dependent biases. Model-based biases result when an individual is biased to choose a particular ""cultural model"" to imitate

. Among the issues identified is the lack of distinction between what trait developed and how it is used, and the underlying reasons or forces that created the novel trait initially.

What are some situations where gesture can be advantageous?,"in a loud environment or where it is important to be silent, such as on a hunt",". Also, gesture is not generally less effective, and depending on the situation can even be advantageous, for example in a loud environment or where it is important to be silent, such as on a hunt. Other challenges to the ""gesture-first"" theory have been presented by researchers in psycholinguistics, including David McNeill.

What is suggested to have contributed substantially to the production and perception of sound?,The production and perception of tool-use sound (TUS) and incidental sound of locomotion (ISOL),". The Tool-use sound hypothesis suggests that the production and perception of sound also contributed substantially, particularly incidental sound of locomotion (ISOL) and tool-use sound (TUS). Human bipedalism resulted in rhythmic and more predictable ISOL. That may have stimulated the evolution of musical abilities, auditory working memory, and abilities to produce complex vocalizations, and to mimic natural sounds

. Since the human brain proficiently extracts information about objects and events from the sounds they produce, TUS, and mimicry of TUS, might have achieved an iconic function. The prevalence of sound symbolism in many extant languages supports this idea. Self-produced TUS activates multimodal brain processing (motor neurons, hearing, proprioception, touch, vision), and TUS stimulates primate audiovisual mirror neurons, which is likely to stimulate the development of association chains

What is the evolutionary association mentioned in the context?,vertebrate vocal communication,"."" Evolutionary psychologists generally presume that, like the body, the mind is made up of many evolved modular adaptations, although there is some disagreement within the discipline regarding the degree of general plasticity, or ""generality,"" of some modules. It has been suggested that modularity evolves because, compared to non-modular networks, it would have conferred an advantage in terms of fitness and because connection costs are lower

Where are areas homologous to the monkey mirror neuron system found in humans?,"In the inferior frontal cortex, close to Broca's area",". This has led to suggestions that human language evolved from a gesture performance/understanding system implemented in mirror neurons. Mirror neurons have been said to have the potential to provide a mechanism for action-understanding, imitation-learning, and the simulation of other people's behavior. This hypothesis is supported by some cytoarchitectonic homologies between monkey premotor area F5 and human Broca's area

. Fogassi and Ferrari (2014) monitored motor cortex activity in monkeys, specifically area F5 in the Broca’s area, where mirror neurons are located. They observed changes in electrical activity in this area when the monkey executed or observed different hand actions performed by someone else. Broca’s area is a region in the frontal lobe responsible for language production and processing

. A gradual change in acoustic properties, meaning, or both could have resulted in arbitrariness and an expanded repertoire of words. Humans have been increasingly exposed to TUS over millions of years, coinciding with the period during which spoken language evolved.

What has been suggested as a possible mechanism for the evolution of human language?,A gesture performance/understanding system implemented in mirror neurons,". Two possible scenarios have been proposed for the development of language, one of which supports the gestural theory: The first perspective that language evolved from the calls of human ancestors seems logical because both humans and animals make sounds or cries. One evolutionary reason to refute this is that, anatomically, the centre that controls calls in monkeys and other animals is located in a completely different part of the brain than in humans

. The problem with these theories is that they rest on the assumption that once early humans had discovered a workable mechanism for linking sounds with meanings, language would automatically have evolved. Much earlier, medieval Muslim scholars developed theories on the origin of language. Their theories were of five general types: From the perspective of signalling theory, the main obstacle to the evolution of language-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one

What is a possible scenario where children can vocally imitate non-words?,Speech shadowing or echolalia,". Rates of vocabulary expansion link to the ability of children to vocally mirror non-words and so to acquire the new word pronunciations. Such speech repetition occurs automatically, quickly and separately in the brain to speech perception. Moreover, such vocal imitation can occur without comprehension such as in speech shadowing and echolalia

. At first, children learned the calls (phonemes) from their parents by imitating their lip-movements (illustration part 5). Eventually, infants were able to encode into long-term memory all the calls (phonemes). Consequentially, mimicry via lip-reading was limited to infancy and older children learned new calls through mimicry without lip-reading (illustration part 6)

. Several models have shown how relatively simple peer-to-peer vocal interactions, such as imitation, can spontaneously self-organise a system of sounds shared by the whole population, and different in different populations. For example, models elaborated by Berrah et al

. Supporting this model is also its ability to explain unique human phenomena, such as the use of intonations when converting words into commands and questions, the tendency of infants to mimic vocalization","According to the context, one possible scenario where children can vocally imitate non-words is through ""speech shadowing"" or ""echolalia"", which occurs automatically, quickly and separately in the brain from speech perception.

Evolutionary psychologists also use various sources of data for testing, including experiments, archaeological records, data from hunter-gatherer societies, observational studies, neuroscience data, self-reports and surveys, public records, and human products. Recently, additional methods and tools have been introduced based on fictional scenarios, mathematical models, and multi-agent computer simulations

. The study is based on a regression analysis of neocortex size plotted against a number of social behaviors of living and extinct hominids.

What is the name of the theory that suggests vocal interactions between early hominid mothers and infants led to the emergence of the first words?,Dean Falk's 'putting-down-the-baby' theory,". In particular, supporters of Noam Chomsky argue against the possibility that the mirror neuron system can play any role in the hierarchical recursive structures essential to syntax.

Why did evolving human mothers have trouble moving around and foraging with their infants?,"Because they lost fur, leaving their infants with no means of clinging on",". The basic idea is that evolving human mothers, unlike their counterparts in other primates, could not move around and forage with their infants clinging onto their backs. Loss of fur in the human case left infants with no means of clinging on. Frequently, therefore, mothers had to put their babies down. As a result, these babies needed to be reassured that they were not being abandoned

. This dimorphism has been seen as an evolutionary adaptation of females to bear lumbar load better during pregnancy, an adaptation that non-bipedal primates would not need to make. Adapting bipedalism would have required less shoulder stability, which allowed the shoulder and other limbs to become more independent of each other and adapt for specific suspensory behaviors

. Furthermore, as the species became more bipedal, specialized feet would prevent the infant from conveniently clinging to the mother – hampering the mother's freedom and thus make her and her offspring more dependent on resources collected by others. Modern monogamous primates such as gibbons tend to be also territorial, but fossil evidence indicates that Australopithecus afarensis lived in large groups

The modern era of evolutionary psychology was ushered in, in particular, by Donald Symons' 1979 book The Evolution of Human Sexuality and Leda Cosmides and John Tooby's 1992 book The Adapted Mind

. The popular science writer Elaine Morgan supported this hypothesis in her 1972 book The Descent of Woman. In it, she contrasted the theory with zoologist and ethnologist Desmond Morris's theories of sexuality, which she believed to be rooted in sexism

."" In 1993, Robert Frank and his associates found that participants in a prisoner's dilemma scenario were often able to predict whether their partners would ""cheat"", based on a half-hour of unstructured social interaction. In a 1996 experiment, for example, Linda Mealey and her colleagues found that people were better at remembering the faces of people when those faces were associated with stories about those individuals cheating (such as embezzling money from a church)

What is the primary source of inspiration for the 'from where to what' language evolution model?,The organization of language processing in the brain,". ""No symbolic system could have survived from one generation to the next if it could not have been easily acquired by young children under their normal conditions of social life."" The ""from where to what"" model is a language evolution model that is derived primarily from the organization of language processing in the brain into two structures: the auditory dorsal stream and the auditory ventral stream. It hypothesizes seven stages of language evolution (see illustration)

. Transcending the continuity-versus-discontinuity divide, some scholars view the emergence of language as the consequence of some kind of social transformation that, by generating unprecedented levels of public trust, liberated a genetic potential for linguistic creativity that had previously lain dormant. ""Ritual/speech coevolution theory"" exemplifies this approach

. The ""origin of language"" as a subject in its own right emerged from studies in neurolinguistics, psycholinguistics and human evolution. The Linguistic Bibliography introduced ""Origin of language"" as a separate heading in 1988, as a sub-topic of psycholinguistics. Dedicated research institutes of evolutionary linguistics are a recent phenomenon, em","The primary source of inspiration for the ""from where to what"" language evolution model is the organization of language processing in the brain into two structures: the auditory dorsal stream and the auditory ventral stream.",1.0,1.0,0.95,0.8,0.9,"The answer correctly identifies the primary source of inspiration as the organization of language processing in the brain.

What was the original purpose of speech?,Exchanging contact calls between mothers and their offspring to find each other in the event they became separated,". --- # Origin of speech The origin of speech differs from the origin of language because language is not necessarily spoken; it could equally be written or signed. Speech is a fundamental aspect of human communication and plays a vital role in the everyday lives of humans. It allows them to convey thoughts, emotions, and ideas, and providing the ability to connect with others and shape collective reality

. Speech originated for the purpose of exchanging contact calls between mothers and their offspring to find one another in the event they became separated (illustration part 1). The contact calls could be modified with intonations in order to express either a higher or lower level of distress (illustration part 2). The use of two types of contact calls enabled the first question-answer conversation

. If the theory that language could have evolved as a single adaptation is accepted, the question becomes which of its many functions has been the basis of adaptation. Several evolutionary hypotheses have been posited: that language evolved for the purpose of social grooming, that it evolved as a way to show mating potential or that it evolved to form social contracts

. I cannot doub","According to the context, the original purpose of speech was exchanging contact calls between mothers and their offspring to find each other in the event they became separated.",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.7,0.0,The LLM correctly identifies the main purpose of speech as exchanging contact calls between mothers and their offspring to find each other in the event they became separated.
What is the purpose of the child's initial low-level distress call in this scenario?,to express a desire to interact with an object,". In this scenario, the child would emit a low-level distress call to express a desire to interact with an object, and the mother would respond with either another low-level distress call (to express approval of the interaction) or a high-level distress call (to express disapproval) (illustration part 3). Over time, the improved use of intonations and vocal control led to the invention of unique calls (phonemes) associated with distinct objects (illustration part 4)

. Speech originated for the purpose of exchanging contact calls between mothers and their offspring to find one another in the event they became separated (illustration part 1). The contact calls could be modified with intonations in order to express either a higher or lower level of distress (illustration part 2). The use of two types of contact calls enabled the first question-answer conversation

. At first, children learned the calls (phonemes) from their parents by imitating their lip-movements (illustration part 5). Eventually, infants were able to encode into long-term memory all the calls (phonemes). Consequentially, mimicry via lip-reading was limited to infancy and older children learned new calls through mim",The purpose of the child's initial low-level distress call is to express a desire to interact with an object.,1.0,1.0,0.95,0.8,0.0,The LLM correctly identifies that the child's distress call is intended to express a desire to interact with an object.
What is the primary method by which infants initially learn phonemes?,Lip-movements,". At first, children learned the calls (phonemes) from their parents by imitating their lip-movements (illustration part 5). Eventually, infants were able to encode into long-term memory all the calls (phonemes). Consequentially, mimicry via lip-reading was limited to infancy and older children learned new calls through mimicry without lip-reading (illustration part 6)

. Conversely, human children are able to ask their first questions (using only question intonation) at the babbling period of their development, long before they start using syntactic structures. Although babies from different cultures acquire native languages from their social environment, all languages of the world without exception—tonal, non-tonal, intonational and accented—use similar rising ""question intonation"" for yes–no questions. Except, of course, the ones that don't

. Rates of vocabulary expansion link to the ability of children to vocally mirror non-words and so to acquire the new word pronunciations. Such speech repetition occurs automatically, quickly and separately in the brain to speech perception. Moreover, such vocal imitation can occur without comprehension such as in speech shadowing and echola","According to the context, infants initially learned phonemes (calls) from their parents by imitating their lip-movements.",0.8,0.9,0.7,0.5,0.0,"The LLM's answer provides a correct description of the initial method by which infants initially learned phonemes, but it could be more specific about the role of imitations and lip-movements in the learning process."
What is the origin of the theory's name?,The theory's name is derived from the two auditory streams,". The theory developed before major discoveries of ancient hominin fossils in East Africa. The hypothesis was initially proposed by the English marine biologist Alister Hardy in 1960, who argued that a branch of apes was forced by competition over terrestrial habitats to hunt for food such as shellfish on the coast and seabed, leading to adaptations that explained distinctive characteristics of modern humans such as functional hairlessness and bipedalism

. The theories on which evolutionary psychology is based originated with Charles Darwin's work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humans. Modern evolutionary psychology, however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th century

. Critics of the speech/ritual co-evolution idea theory include Noam Chomsky, who terms it the ""non-existence"" hypothesis—a denial of the very existence of language as an object of study for natural science. Chomsky's own theory is that language emerged in an instant and in perfect form, prompting his critics in turn, to retort that only something that does not exist—a theoretical construct or convenient scientific fiction—could ","The origin of the theory's name is not mentioned in the provided context. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the theory is likely named after Alister Hardy, the English marine biologist who initially proposed it in 1960.

What is the auditory dorsal stream responsible for in primates?,sound localization,". The auditory ventral stream is responsible for sound recognition, and so it is referred to as the auditory what stream. In primates, the auditory dorsal stream is responsible for sound localization, and thus it is called the auditory where stream

. The emergence of each of these functions in the auditory dorsal stream represents an intermediate stage in the evolution of language. A contact call origin for human language is consistent with animal studies, as like human language, contact call discrimination in monkeys is lateralised to the left hemisphere. Mice with knock-out to language related genes (such as FOXP2 and SRPX2) also resulted in the pups no longer emitting contact calls when separated from their mothers

. Only in humans (in the left hemisphere) is it also responsible for other processes associated with language use and acquisition, such as speech repetition and production, integration of phonemes with their lip movements, perception and production of intonations, phonological long-term memory (long-term memory storage of the sounds of words), and phonological working memory (the temporary storage of the sounds of words).

What is a unique human phenomenon that this model explains?,the use of intonations when converting words into commands and questions,". Supporting this model is also its ability to explain unique human phenomena, such as the use of intonations when converting words into commands and questions, the tendency of infants to mimic vocalizations during the first year of life (and its disappearance later on) and the protruding and visible human lips, which are not found in other apes. This theory could be considered an elaboration of the putting-down-the-baby theory of language evolution

. One example is the evolutionary psychology model of extended social groups selecting for modern human brains, a contradiction being that the synaptic function of modern human brains require high amounts of many specific essential nutrients so that such a transition to higher requirements of the same essential nutrients being shared by all individuals in a population would decrease the possibility of forming large groups due to bottleneck foods with rare essential nutrients capping group sizes

. The individual human brain has to explain a phenomenon in order to comprehend and relate to it. This activity predates by far the emergence of language and may have caused it. The theory is, belief in the supernatural emerges from hypotheses ","According to the context, one of the unique human phenomena that this model explains is the use of intonations when converting words into commands and questions.",1.0,1.0,0.95,0.8,0.0,"The context suggests that the model is correct, but the specific explanation could be improved by including more details about the process of converting words into commands and questions."
What is one reason why grammar evolves?,Humans care less about grammatical niceties than about making themselves understood,". ""Grammaticalization"" is a continuous historical process in which free-standing words develop into grammatical appendages, while these in turn become ever more specialized and grammatical. An initially ""incorrect"" usage, in becoming accepted, leads to unforeseen consequences, triggering knock-on effects and extended sequences of change. Paradoxically, grammar evolves because, in the final analysis, humans care less about grammatical niceties than about making themselves understood

. If this is how grammar evolves today, according to this school of thought, similar principles at work can be legitimately inferred among distant human ancestors, when grammar itself was first being established. In order to reconstruct the evolutionary transition from early language to languages with complex grammars, it is necessary to know which hypothetical sequences are plausible and which are not

. A criticism of all this is that while grammaticalization theory might explain language change today, it does not satisfactorily address the really difficult challenge—explaining the initial transition from primate-style communication to language as it is known today. Rather, the theory assumes that lan","According to the context, one reason why grammar evolves is because humans care less about grammatical niceties than about making themselves understood.",0.7,0.6,0.8,0.5,0.8,"The answer is factually correct, but it does not capture the nuances of grammaticalization, which is not explicitly discussed in the context."
What is the purpose of inferring principles of grammar evolution among distant human ancestors?,To reconstruct the evolutionary transition from early language to languages with complex grammars,". If this is how grammar evolves today, according to this school of thought, similar principles at work can be legitimately inferred among distant human ancestors, when grammar itself was first being established. In order to reconstruct the evolutionary transition from early language to languages with complex grammars, it is necessary to know which hypothetical sequences are plausible and which are not

. This is to highlight that even though grammar may have been unavailable, use of foresight, planning and symbolic thought can be evidence of language as early as one million years ago with Homo erectus. Homo heidelbergensis was a close relative (most probably a migratory descendant) of Homo ergaster

. Currently, several competing theories about the evolutionary origin of language coexist, none of them having achieved a general consensus. Researchers of language acquisition in primates and humans such as Michael Tomasello and Talmy Givón, argue that the innatist framework has understated the role of imitation in learning and that it is not at all necessary to posit the existence of an innate grammar module to explain human language acquisition

Scholars wishing to study the origi",The purpose of inferring principles of grammar evolution among distant human ancestors is to reconstruct the evolutionary transition from early language to languages with complex grammars.,0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.0,"While the LLM is correct in stating that grammar evolves over time, the inferred purpose is not as clear. The context does not explicitly mention the purpose of this evolution, and the explanation lacks depth."
What is the primary method speakers use to convey abstract ideas?,to fall back on immediately recognizable concrete imagery,". In order to convey abstract ideas, the first recourse of speakers is to fall back on immediately recognizable concrete imagery, very often deploying metaphors rooted in shared bodily experience. A familiar example is the use of concrete terms such as ""belly"" or ""back"" to convey abstract meanings such as ""inside"" or ""behind"". Equally metaphorical is the strategy of representing temporal patterns on the model of spatial ones

. They want to know what the speaker has in mind. Grammaticalisation is essentially based on metaphor. To outlaw its use would be to stop grammar from evolving and, by the same token, to exclude all possibility of expressing abstract thought

. Ideas are transformed every time they are passed from mind to mind, because the sender's message is being interpreted by evolved inference systems in the receiver. It is useful for some applications to note, however, that there are ways to pass ideas which are more resilient and involve substantially less mutation, such as by mass distribution of printed media

. In short, while a noun-only language might seem theoretically possible, grammaticalization theory indicates that it cannot have remained fixed in that state fo","According to the context, the primary method speakers use to convey abstract ideas is to fall back on immediately recognizable concrete imagery, often deploying metaphors rooted in shared bodily experience.",0.7,0.8,0.5,0.3,0.0,"While the answer is factually correct, it does not accurately capture the essence of the context or provide any insightful information about how speakers convey abstract ideas."
What direction does grammaticalisation typically take?,from concrete to abstract,". As Bernd Heine and Tania Kuteva acknowledge: ""Grammaticalisation requires a linguistic system that is used regularly and frequently within a community of speakers and is passed on from one group of speakers to another"". Outside modern humans, such conditions do not prevail. Human language is used for self-expression; however, expression displays different stages

What is the primary concern of 'Machiavellian' primates?,Demonstrating reliability,". Primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable, but they remain reliable for the same reason—because they are hard to fake. Primate social intelligence is ""Machiavellian""—self-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples. Monkeys and apes often attempt to deceive each other, while at the same time remaining constantly on guard against falling victim to deception themselves

. The signal is trusted, not because the cat is inclined to be honest, but because it just cannot fake that sound. Primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable, but they remain reliable for the same reason—because they are hard to fake. Primate social intelligence is ""Machiavellian""; that is, self-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples

. Imaginative creativity—emitting a leopard alarm when no leopard was present, for example—is not the kind of behaviour which, say, vervet monkeys would appreciate or reward. Creativity and reliability are incompatible demands; for ""Machiavellian"" primates as for animals generally, the overriding pressure is to demonstrate reliability. If humans escape these constraints, it is because in their case, listeners are primarily interested in mental states

Barbar",The primary concern of 'Machiavellian' primates is to demonstrate reliability.,1.0,1.0,0.8,0.7,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the main concern of 'Machiavellian' primates as demonstrating reliability.

What is an example of accepting fictions as potentially informative and interesting?,Metaphor,". To focus on mental states is to accept fictions—inhabitants of the imagination—as potentially informative and interesting. An example is metaphor: a metaphor is, literally, a false statement. In Romeo and Juliet, Romeo declares ""Juliet is the sun!"". Juliet is a woman, not a ball of plasma in the sky, but human listeners are not (or not usually) pedants insistent on point-by-point factual accuracy. They want to know what the speaker has in mind

.[unreliable source?] Such mechanisms may include the ability to infer the presence of organisms that might do harm (agent detection), the ability to come up with causal narratives for natural events (etiology), and the ability to recognize that other people have minds of their own with their own beliefs, desires and intentions (theory of mind)

.[page needed] However, their caution against committing the naturalistic fallacy has been criticized as means to stifle legitimate ethical discussions. Some criticisms of evolutionary psychology point at contradictions between different aspects of adaptive scenarios posited by evolutionary psychology

"What do dolphins, Eurasian magpies, and chimpanzees exhibit when viewing their own reflections?",Self-consciousness,". The consciousness of self and feelings represents the stage immediately prior to the external, phonetic expression of feelings in the form of sound (i.e. language). Intelligent animals such as dolphins, Eurasian magpies, and chimpanzees live in communities, wherein they assign themselves roles for group survival and show emotions such as sympathy. When such animals view their reflection (mirror test), they recognize themselves and exhibit self-consciousness

What helped facilitate human survival and further advancement?,"Tools, shelter, and fire",". Notably, humans evolved in a quite different environment than that of these animals. Human survival became easier with the development of tools, shelter, and fire, thus facilitating further advancement of social interaction, self-expression, and tool-making, as for hunting and gathering

. Current consensus about the evolutionary development of the human brain accepts sexual selection as a potential contributing factor but maintains that human intelligence and the ability to store and share cultural knowledge would have likely carried high survival value as well

. The increasing brain size allowed advanced provisioning and tools and the technological advances during the Palaeolithic era that built upon the previous evolutionary innovations of bipedalism and hand versatility allowed the development of human language

What was a result of the increasing brain size during the Palaeolithic era?,Advanced provisioning and tools,". The increasing brain size allowed advanced provisioning and tools and the technological advances during the Palaeolithic era that built upon the previous evolutionary innovations of bipedalism and hand versatility allowed the development of human language

. During human evolution, on at least two occasions, hominid brain size increased rapidly over a short period of time followed by a period of stasis. The first period of brain expansion occurred 2.5 million years ago, when Homo habilis first began using stone tools. The second period occurred 500,000 years ago, with the emergence of archaic Homo sapiens

. Increasing brain size has also been significant in human evolution. It began to increase approximately 2.4 million years ago, but modern levels of brain size were not attained until after 500,000 years ago. Zoological analyses have shown that the size of human brains is significantly larger than what anatomists would expect for their size. The human brain is three to four times larger than its closest relative, which is the chimpanzee

The proposed increases in brain size from food processing will have led to a greater mental capacity for further cultural innovation in food","According to the context, the result of the increasing brain size during the Palaeolithic era was the development of human language.",0.7,0.8,0.9,0.6,0.8,"The context mentions the increasing brain size during the Palaeolithic era, but it is not clear how it relates to the development of human language."
What is the main difference in song pattern between white-rumped munias and Bengalese finches?,"The wild munias use a highly stereotyped song sequence, whereas the domesticated ones sing a highly unconstrained song.",". According to a study investigating the song differences between white-rumped munias and its domesticated counterpart (Bengalese finch), the wild munias use a highly stereotyped song sequence, whereas the domesticated ones sing a highly unconstrained song. In wild finches, song syntax is subject to female preference—sexual selection—and remains relatively fixed

. However, in the Bengalese finch, natural selection is replaced by breeding, in this case for colorful plumage, and thus, decoupled from selective pressures, stereotyped song syntax is allowed to drift. It is replaced, supposedly within 1000 generations, by a variable and learned sequence. Wild finches, moreover, are thought incapable of learning song sequences from other finches

What is the primary forebrain motor centre that connects to midbrain vocal outputs in brains capable of producing only an innate song?,The robust nucleus of arcopallium,". In the field of bird vocalization, brains capable of producing only an innate song have very simple neural pathways: the primary forebrain motor centre, called the robust nucleus of arcopallium, connects to midbrain vocal outputs, which in turn project to brainstem motor nuclei. By contrast, in brains capable of learning songs, the arcopallium receives input from numerous additional forebrain regions, including those involved in learning and social experience

. Pierre-Yves Oudeyer developed models which showed that basic neural equipment for adaptive holistic vocal imitation, coupling directly motor and perceptual representations in the brain, can generate spontaneously shared combinatorial systems of vocalisations, including phonotactic patterns, in a society of babbling individuals

. Since the human brain proficiently extracts information about objects and events from the sounds they produce, TUS, and mimicry of TUS, might have achieved an iconic function. The prevalence of sound symbolism in many extant languages supports this idea. Self-produced TUS activates multimodal brain processing (motor neurons, hearing, proprioception, touch, vision), and TUS stimulates primate audi","According to the context, the primary forebrain motor centre that connects to midbrain vocal outputs in brains capable of producing only an innate song is the ""robust nucleus of arcopallium"".",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.0,"The LLM generated answer is somewhat relevant to the ground truth, but it does not accurately describe the primary forebrain motor centre that connects to midbrain vocal outputs."
What is one way to think about human evolution?,That humans are self-domesticated apes,". --- # Timeline of human evolution The timeline of human evolution outlines the major events in the evolutionary lineage of the modern human species, Homo sapiens, throughout the history of life, beginning some 4 billion years ago down to recent evolution within H. sapiens during and since the Last Glacial Period. It includes brief explanations of the various taxonomic ranks in the human lineage

--- # Human evolution Homo sapiens is a distinct species of the hominid family of primates, which also includes all the great apes. Over their evolutionary history, humans gradually developed traits such as bipedalism, dexterity, and complex language, as well as interbreeding with other hominins (a tribe of the African hominid subfamily), indicating that human evolution was not linear but weblike

. The linear view of human evolution began to be abandoned in the 1970s as different species of humans were discovered that made the linear concept increasingly unlikely. In the 21st century with the advent of molecular biology techniques and computerization, whole-genome sequencing of Neanderthal and human genome were performed, confirming recent admixture between different human species

. The","One way to think about human evolution is that it was not linear but weblike, meaning that humans gradually developed traits such as bipedalism, dexterity, and complex language through interbreeding with other hominins.",0.8,0.9,0.7,0.6,0.9,"The LLM correctly mentions that human evolution was not linear but weblike, but it does not provide a detailed or accurate description of how humans developed traits through interbreeding."

What is a unique characteristic of mammalian brain development?,"They construct themselves 'bottom up', with one set of neuronal interactions preparing for the next round of interactions",". Given the highly indeterminate way that mammalian brains develop—they basically construct themselves ""bottom up"", with one set of neuronal interactions preparing for the next round of interactions—degraded pathways would tend to seek out and find new opportunities for synaptic hookups. Such inherited de-differentiations of brain pathways might have contributed to the functional complexity that characterises human language

. Although there is no evidence in the fossil record, it is likely that these animals had a constant body temperature, hair and milk glands for their young (the glands stemmed from the milk line). The neocortex (part of the cerebrum) region of the brain evolves in Mammalia, at the reduction of the tectum (non-smell senses which were processed here became integrated into neocortex but smell became primary sense)

. Fitch argues that these two approaches can be rectified with the study of ""neutral computation and mammalian brain development"". It may be more useful to consider specific components of neural computation and development, what has been selected for, and to what end. Ploeger and Galis tackled modular evolvability and developmental constraints in human ","According to the context, a unique characteristic of mammalian brain development is that it ""constructs itself 'bottom up'"", with one set of neuronal interactions preparing for the next round of interactions.

What is the primary method of encoding and transmitting linguistic information?,Speech,". And, as exemplified by the finches, such de-differentiations can occur in very rapid time-frames. A distinction can be drawn between speech and language. Language is not necessarily spoken: it might alternatively be written or signed. Speech is among a number of different methods of encoding and transmitting linguistic information, albeit arguably[by whom?] the most natural one

. Then, when released from the taboo, these same individuals resume narrating stories by the fireside or in the dark, switching to pure sound without sacrifice of informational content. Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. Humans' first recourse is to encode their thoughts in sound – a method which depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus

. The human linguistic property of modality independence is conceptually distinct from polymodality. It allows the speaker to encode the informational content of a message in a single channel whilst switching between channels as necessary. Modern city-dwellers switch effortlessly between the spoken word and writing in its various forms – handwriting, typing, email, etc. Whi","According to the context, speaking (or speech) is among a number of different methods of encoding and transmitting linguistic information, and arguably the most natural one.

Do some scholars deny that recursion is a universal feature of human language?,yes,". Some scholars, such as Noam Chomsky, view language as an initially cognitive development, its ""externalisation"" to serve communicative purposes occurring later in human evolution. According to one such school of thought, the key feature distinguishing human language is recursion, (in this context, the iterative embedding of phrases within phrases). Other scholars—notably Daniel Everett—deny that recursion is universal, citing certain languages (e.g

. Recent language theories present recursion as the unique facet of human language and theory of mind. However, breaking down language into its symbolic parts: separating meaning from the requirements of grammar, it becomes possible to see that language does not depend on either recursion or grammar. This can be evidenced by the Pirahã language users in Brazil that have no myth or creation stories, no numbers and no colors within their language

. In particular, supporters of Noam Chomsky argue against the possibility that the mirror neuron system can play any role in the hierarchical recursive structures essential to syntax. According to Dean Falk's ""putting-down-the-baby"" theory, vocal interactions between early hominid mothers and ","Yes, according to the context, some scholars, notably Daniel Everett, deny that recursion is a universal feature of human language. They cite certain languages (e.g. Pirahã) as examples where recursion may not be present.",1.0,0.8,0.7,0.6,0.0,The answer accurately identifies the context's mention of recursive features in language development but provides an incorrect answer in the context of recursion itself.
Did captive primates (notably bonobos and chimpanzees) prove able to ask questions?,No,".g. Pirahã) which allegedly[by whom?] lack this feature. The ability to ask questions is considered by some[like whom?] to distinguish language from non-human systems of communication. Some captive primates (notably bonobos and chimpanzees), having learned to use rudimentary signing to communicate with their human trainers, proved able to respond correctly to complex questions and requests. Yet they failed to ask even the simplest questions themselves

. Similarly, researchers have demonstrated that chimpanzees (in captivity) use different ""words"" in reference to different foods. They recorded vocalisations that chimps made in reference, for example, to grapes, and then other chimps pointed at pictures of grapes when they heard the recorded sound. A study published in HOMO: Journal of Comparative Human Biology in 2017 claims that Ardipithecus ramidus, a hominin dated at approximately 4

What is a common feature of all languages in the world?,The use of similar rising 'question intonation' for yes-no questions,". By combining the atomic elements or ""features"" with which all humans are innately equipped, anyone may in principle generate the entire range of vowels and consonants to be found in any of the world's languages, whether past, present or future. The distinctive features are in this sense atomic components of a universal language. In recent years, the notion of an innate ""universal grammar"" underlying phonological variation has been called into question

. Studies of creole languages around the world have suggested that they display remarkable similarities in grammar and are developed uniformly from pidgins in a single generation. These similarities are apparent even when creoles do not have any common language origins. In addition, creoles are similar, despite being developed in isolation from each other. Syntactic similarities include subject–verb–object word order

. The most comprehensive monograph ever written about speech sounds, The Sounds of the World's Languages, by Peter Ladefoged and Ian Maddieson, found virtually no basis for the postulation of some small number of fixed, discrete, universal phonetic features. Examining 305 languages, for example, they encountered vowel","According to the context, a common feature of all humans that can be used to generate the entire range of vowels and consonants found in any language is the atomic elements or ""features"" with which all humans are innately equipped.",0.8,0.6,0.7,0.4,0.9,"The LLM's answer provides a correct answer, but it does not demonstrate the same level of understanding or insight as the ground truth answer."
"According to some authors, what is pivotal in spoken grammar?",sentence intonation/pitch,". Except, of course, the ones that don't. [clarification needed] This fact is a strong evidence of the universality of question intonation. In general, according to some authors[like whom?], sentence intonation/pitch is pivotal in spoken grammar and is the basic information used by children to learn the grammar of whatever language. Language users have high-level reference (or deixis)—the ability to refer to things or states of being that are not in the immediate realm of the speaker

. In short, while a noun-only language might seem theoretically possible, grammaticalization theory indicates that it cannot have remained fixed in that state for any length of time. Creativity drives grammatical change. This presupposes a certain attitude on the part of listeners. Instead of punishing deviations from accepted usage, listeners must prioritise imaginative mind-reading

. They want to know what the speaker has in mind. Grammaticalisation is essentially based on metaphor. To outlaw its use would be to stop grammar from evolving and, by the same token, to exclude all possibility of expressing abstract thought

Pinker follows Chomsky in arguing that the fact that children can learn any h","According to the context, sentence intonation/pitch is pivotal in spoken grammar, according to some authors.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.0,"The LLM's answer is somewhat correct, but it does not capture the full nuance of the term 'pivotal'.

What cognitive ability is often linked to theory of mind?,Empathy,". This ability is often related to theory of mind, or an awareness of the other as a being like the self with individual wants and intentions

. The fundamental importance of animal social skills lies within the ability to manage relationships and in turn, the ability to not just commit information to memory, but manipulate it as well. An adaptive response to the challenges of social interaction and living is theory of mind. Theory of mind as defined by Martin Brüne, is the ability to infer another individual's mental states or emotions. Having a strong theory of mind is tied closely with possessing advanced social intelligence

. Ultimately, there is some consensus within the field that a theory of mind is necessary for language use. Thus, the development of a full theory of mind in humans was a necessary precursor to full language use. In one particular study, rats and pigeons were required to press a button a certain number of times to get food. The animals showed very accurate distinction for numbers less than four, but as the numbers increased, the error rate increased

. Moreover, Baron-Cohen argues that many primates show some, but not all, of these abilities. Call and Tomas","According to the context, the cognitive ability often linked to theory of mind is social intelligence. It is mentioned that having a strong theory of mind is tied closely with possessing advanced social intelligence.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.5,0.0,"The answer correctly identifies social intelligence as a cognitive ability linked to theory of mind, but it provides a rather generic definition."
"According to Simon Baron-Cohen (1999), when did humans use characteristics such as theory of mind?","as much as 40,000 years ago",". According to Chomsky, Hauser and Fitch (2002), there are six main aspects of this high-level reference system: Simon Baron-Cohen (1999) argues that theory of mind must have preceded language use, based on evidence of use of the following characteristics as much as 40,000 years ago: intentional communication, repairing failed communication, teaching, intentional persuasion, intentional deception, building shared plans and goals, intentional sharing of focus or topic, and pretending

. Moreover, Baron-Cohen argues that many primates show some, but not all, of these abilities. Call and Tomasello's research on chimpanzees supports this, in that individual chimps seem to understand that other chimps have awareness, knowledge, and intention, but do not seem to understand false beliefs.

Chimpanzees are also known to mourn the dead, and notice things that have only aesthetic value, like sunsets, both of which may be considered to be components of religion or spirituality.[unreliable source?] The difference between the comprehension of causality by humans and chimpanzees is one of degree. The degree of comprehension in an animal depends upon the size of the prefrontal cortex: the greater the size of the prefrontal cortex the deeper the comprehension

Paradoxically, it is theorized that primates' resistance to deception is what blocks the evolution of their signalling systems along language-like lin","Based on the provided context, the answer would be:

Initial behavioral analysis indicated that Ardipithecus could be very similar to chimpanzees; however, more recent analysis based on canine size and lack of canine sexual dimorphism indicates that Ardipithecus was characterised by reduced aggression, and that they more closely resemble bonobos

. Between 1999 and 2003, a multidisciplinary team led by Sileshi Semaw discovered bones and teeth of nine A. ramidus individuals at As Duma in the Gona area of Ethiopia's Afar Region. The fossils were dated to between 4.35 and 4.45 million years old. Ardipithecus ramidus had a small brain, measuring between 300 and 350 cm3

This study compared the skull of A. ramidus with 29 chimpanzee skulls of different ages and found that in numerous features A. ramidus clustered with the infant and juvenile measures as opposed to the adult measures. Such affinity with the shape dimensions of infant and juvenile chimpanzee skull architecture, it was argued, may have resulted in greater vocal capability

. The time range for the evolution of language or its anatomical prerequisites extends, at least in principle, from the phylogenetic divergence of Homo from Pan to the emergence of full behavioral modernity some 50,000–150,000 years ago. Few dispute that Australopithecus probably lacked vocal communication significantly more sophisticated than that of great apes in general, but scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of Homo some 2.5 million years ago

When did the anatomical features associated with bipedalism develop in australopithecines?,Around 3.5 million years ago,". However, given the selective advantages of pro-social vocal synchrony, we suggest the species would have developed significantly more complex vocal abilities than chimpanzees and bonobos. Anatomically, some scholars believe that features of bipedalism developed in the australopithecines around 3.5 million years ago. Around this time, these structural developments within the skull led to a more prominently L-shaped vocal tract

. Earlier fossils, such as Orrorin tugenensis, indicate bipedalism around six million years ago, around the time of the split between humans and chimpanzees indicated by genetic studies. This suggests that erect, straight-legged walking originated as an adaptation to tree-dwelling. Major changes to the pelvis and feet had already taken place before Australopithecus. It was once thought that humans descended from a knuckle-walking ancestor, but this is not well-supported

. There are at least twelve distinct hypotheses as to how and why bipedalism evolved in humans, and also some debate as to when. Bipedalism evolved well before the large human brain or the development of stone tools.

"What is necessary for Early Homo populations to generate modern human sounds, such as vowels?",A specifically shaped voice tract and a lower sitting larynx,".[page needed] In order to generate the sounds modern Homo sapiens are capable of making, such as vowels, it is vital that Early Homo populations must have a specifically shaped voice track and a lower sitting larynx. Opposing research previously suggested that Neanderthals were physically incapable of creating the full range of vocals seen in modern humans due to the differences in larynx placement

. Lacking direct linguistic evidence, specialists in human origins have resorted to the study of anatomical features and genes arguably associated with speech production. Whilst such studies may provide information as to whether pre-modern Homo species had speech capacities, it is still unknown whether they actually spoke.

Was there a distinct difference found between the hyoid bones of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals?,No,". The discovery of a modern-looking hyoid bone of a Neanderthal man in the Kebara Cave in Israel led its discoverers to argue that the Neanderthals had a descended larynx, and thus human-like speech capabilities. However, other researchers have claimed that the morphology of the hyoid is not indicative of the larynx's position. It is necessary to take into consideration the skull base, the mandible, the cervical vertebrae and a cranial reference plane

. Establishing distinct larynx positions through fossil remains of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals would support this theory; however, modern research has revealed that the hyoid bone was indistinguishable in the two populations. Though research has shown a lower sitting larynx is important to producing speech, another theory states it may not be as important as once thought

. Bart de Boer in 2017 acknowledges this ambiguity of a universally accepted Neanderthal vocal tract; however, he notes the similarities in the thoracic vertebral canal, potential air sacs, and hyoid bones between modern humans and Neanderthals to suggest the presence of complex speech. For two million years following the emergence of Homo habilis, the stone tool ","According to the context, modern research has revealed that the hyoid bone was indistinguishable in the two populations (Homo sapiens and Neanderthals), meaning there was no distinct difference found.",0.5,0.2,0.3,0.6,0.8,"The answer is partially correct, but it significantly oversimplifies the debate.

Hmmmmm is an acronym for holistic (non-compositional), manipulative (utterances are commands or suggestions, not descriptive statements), multi-modal (acoustic as well as gestural and facial), musical, and mimetic. Evidence for Homo erectus potentially using language comes in the form of Acheulean tool usage. The use of abstract thought in the formation of Acheulean hand axes coincides with the symbol creation necessary for simple language

"Do Pirahã language users in Brazil have a language with mythology, numbers, and colors?",No,". Recent language theories present recursion as the unique facet of human language and theory of mind. However, breaking down language into its symbolic parts: separating meaning from the requirements of grammar, it becomes possible to see that language does not depend on either recursion or grammar. This can be evidenced by the Pirahã language users in Brazil that have no myth or creation stories, no numbers and no colors within their language

. For example, Rotokas, a language of New Guinea, and Pirahã, spoken in South America, both have just 11 phonemes, whilst !Xun, a language spoken in Southern Africa has 141 phonemes.

The earliest analyses were of Neanderthal DNA, and indicated that the Neanderthal contribution to modern human genetic diversity was no more than 20%, with a most likely value of 0%. By 2010, however, detailed DNA sequencing of the Neanderthal specimens from Europe indicated that the contribution was nonzero, with Neanderthals sharing 1-4% more genetic variants with living non-Africans than with living humans in sub-Saharan Africa

. Following the genome sequencing of three Vindija Neanderthals, a draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome was published and revealed that Neanderthals shared more alleles with Eurasian populations—such as French, Han Chinese, and Papua New Guinean—than with sub-Saharan African populations, such as Yoruba and San

How long did the stone tool technology of hominins change very little?,Two million years,". Debate continues as to whether a ""revolution"" led to modern humans (""big bang of human consciousness""), or whether the evolution was more gradual. Until about 50,000–40,000 years ago, the use of stone tools seems to have progressed stepwise. Each phase (H. habilis, H. ergaster, H. neanderthalensis) marked a new technology, followed by very slow development until the next phase. Currently paleoanthropologists are debating whether these Homo species possessed some or many modern human behaviors

. Stone tools are first attested around 2.6 million years ago, when hominins in Eastern Africa used so-called core tools, choppers made out of round cores that had been split by simple strikes. This marks the beginning of the Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age; its end is taken to be the end of the last Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago

. Researchers have suggested that early hominins were thus under evolutionary pressure to increase their capacity to create and use tools.

Is the human larynx descended?,true,". It is now realised that its lowered position is not unique to Homo sapiens, whilst its relevance to vocal flexibility may have been overstated: although men have a lower larynx, they do not produce a wider range of sounds than women or two-year-old babies. There is no evidence that the larynx position of the Neanderthals impeded the range of vowel sounds they could produce

The discovery of a modern-looking hyoid bone of a Neanderthal man in the Kebara Cave in Israel led its discoverers to argue that the Neanderthals had a descended larynx, and thus human-like speech capabilities. However, other researchers have claimed that the morphology of the hyoid is not indicative of the larynx's position. It is necessary to take into consideration the skull base, the mandible, the cervical vertebrae and a cranial reference plane

However, other researchers have questioned whether the morphology of the hyoid bone alone is indicative of the larynx's position.

There is no evidence that the larynx position of the Neanderthals impeded the range","According to the context, males experience a second descent of the larynx at puberty.",1.0,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.0,"The LLM correctly states that a second descent of the larynx occurs at puberty, but it provides no specific information about the context or how it influences this phenomenon."
What was the topic of Quentin Atkinson's 2011 publication?,A survey of phonemes from 500 different languages,". In response to the objection that the larynx is descended in human females, Fitch suggests that mothers vocalizing to protect their infants would also have benefited from this ability. In 2011, Quentin Atkinson published a survey of phonemes from 500 different languages as well as language families and compared their phonemic diversity by region, number of speakers and distance from Africa

. Therefore, the task facing researchers into the origins of language is more multidisciplinary than is usually supposed. It involves addressing the evolutionary emergence of human ritual, kinship, religion and symbolic culture taken as a whole, with language an important but subsidiary component. In a 2023 article, Cedric Boeckx endorses the Rappaport/Searle/Knight way of capturing the ""special"" nature of human words. Words are symbols

. For example, Kieran McNulty covers the potential utilities and constraints of using incomplete fossil taxa to examine longitudinal development in Australopithecus africanis. Many studies on development have been human-specific. In his 2011 paper, Bernard Crespi focused on adaptation and genomic conflict in childhood diseases. He considers the evolution of ch","Quentin Atkinson's 2011 publication was a survey of phonemes from 500 different languages as well as language families, comparing their phonemic diversity by region, number of speakers and distance from Africa.",0.8,0.6,0.7,0.4,0.8,The LLM correctly identifies the topic but provides irrelevant details. The answer could have been improved by focusing on the key topic and providing more context.
"According to Atkinson's model, where did language originate?","Western, central, or southern Africa",". The survey revealed that African languages had the largest number of phonemes, and Oceania and South America had the smallest number. After allowing for the number of speakers, the phonemic diversity was compared to over 2000 possible origin locations. Atkinson's ""best fit"" model is that language originated in western, central, or southern Africa between 80,000 and 160,000 years ago. This predates the hypothesized southern coastal peopling of Arabia, India, southeast Asia, and Australia

. I cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man's own instinctive cries. In 1861, historical linguist Max Müller published a list of speculative theories concerning the origins of spoken language: Most scholars today consider all such theories not so much wrong—they occasionally offer peripheral insights—as naïve and irrelevant

. It would also mean that the origin of language occurred at the same time as the emergence of symbolic culture. Numerous linguists have criticized Atkinson's paper as misrepresenting both the phonemic data and processes of linguistic change, as l","According to the context, according to Atkinson's ""best fit"" model, language originated in western, central, or southern Africa between 80,000 and 160,000 years ago.",0.8,0.6,0.9,0.7,0.9,"The LLM generated answer is somewhat relevant, but it is not specific enough to pinpoint the origin of language in accordance with Atkinson's model."
Does language complexity directly correlate to its age?,No,". It would also mean that the origin of language occurred at the same time as the emergence of symbolic culture. Numerous linguists have criticized Atkinson's paper as misrepresenting both the phonemic data and processes of linguistic change, as language complexity does not necessarily correspond to age, and of failing to take into account the borrowing of phonemes from neighbouring languages, as some Bantu languages have done with click consonants

."" Berwick and Chomsky therefore suggest language emerged approximately between 200,000 years ago and 60,000 years ago (between the appearance of the first anatomically modern humans in southern Africa and the last exodus from Africa respectively). ""That leaves us with about 130,000 years, or approximately 5,000–6,000 generations of time for evolutionary change. This is not 'overnight in one generation' as some have (incorrectly) inferred—but neither is it on the scale of geological eons

A criticism of all this is that while grammaticalization theory might explain language change today, it does not satisfactorily address the really difficult challenge—explaining the initial transition from primate-style communication to language as i","No, according to the context, numerous linguists have criticized Atkinson's paper for suggesting that language complexity does not necessarily correspond to age.",0.75,0.85,0.9,0.8,0.0,The answer accurately reflects the context but gives a slightly misleading interpretation of the meaning of language complexity.

What is the Hindu goddess of speech also referred to as?,speech personified,". Mystical languages used to communicate with animals or spirits, such as the language of the birds, are also common, and were of particular interest during the Renaissance. Vāc is the Hindu goddess of speech, or ""speech personified"". As Brahman's ""sacred utterance"", she has a cosmological role as the ""Mother of the Vedas"". The Aztecs' story maintains that only a man, Coxcox, and a woman, Xochiquetzal, survived a flood, having floated on a piece of bark

. Either it is performing gymnastics with its tongue or it is vocalising; it cannot perform both activities simultaneously. Since this applies to mammals in general, Homo sapiens are exceptional in harnessing mechanisms designed for respiration and ingestion for the radically different requirements of articulate speech. The word ""language"" derives from the Latin lingua, ""tongue"". Phoneticians agree that the tongue is the most important speech articulator, followed by the lips

"According to the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, what event caused people to start speaking different languages?",The arrival of a dove,". They found themselves on land and had many children who were at first born unable to speak, but subsequently, upon the arrival of a dove, were endowed with language, although each one was given a different speech such that they could not understand one another. In the Old Testament, the Book of Genesis (chapter 11) says that God prevented the Tower of Babel from being completed through a miracle that made its construction workers start speaking different languages

In what year did the Linguistic Society of Paris ban all discussion of the origin of language?,1866,". The shortage of direct, empirical evidence has caused many scholars to regard the entire topic as unsuitable for serious study; in 1866, the Linguistic Society of Paris banned any existing or future debates on the subject, a prohibition which remained influential across much of the Western world until the late twentieth century. Various hypotheses have been developed on the emergence of language

.[clarification needed] Modern linguistics did not begin until the late 18th century, and the Romantic or animist theses of Johann Gottfried Herder and Johann Christoph Adelung remained influential well into the 19th century. The question of language origin seemed inaccessible to methodical approaches, and in 1866 the Linguistic Society of Paris famously banned all discussion of the origin of language, deeming it to be an unanswerable problem

What is the primary difference between the origin of speech and the origin of language?,"Language can be written or signed, whereas speech refers specifically to spoken communication.",". --- # Origin of speech The origin of speech differs from the origin of language because language is not necessarily spoken; it could equally be written or signed. Speech is a fundamental aspect of human communication and plays a vital role in the everyday lives of humans. It allows them to convey thoughts, emotions, and ideas, and providing the ability to connect with others and shape collective reality

Do monkeys or apes use their tongues for sound production?,No,". Many attempts have been made to explain scientifically how speech emerged in humans, although to date no theory has generated agreement. Non-human primates, like many other animals, have evolved specialized mechanisms for producing sounds for purposes of social communication. On the other hand, no monkey or ape uses its tongue for such purposes

. The speech organs evolved in the first instance not for speech but for more basic bodily functions such as feeding and breathing. Nonhuman primates have broadly similar organs, but with different neural controls. Non-human apes use their highly-flexible, maneuverable tongues for eating but not for vocalizing. When an ape is not eating, fine motor control over its tongue is deactivated

. Primates are known to make ""vocal calls"", and these calls are generated by circuits in the brainstem and limbic system. In the wild, the communication of vervet monkeys has been the most extensively studied. They are known to make up to ten different vocalizations. Many of these are used to warn other members of the group about approaching predators. They include a ""leopard call"", a ""snake call"", and an ""eagle call""

What is a striking feature of language according to the given context?,That it is modality-independent,"...) and then later learn their precise meanings. These results can be seen as evidence for the application of the ""open-ended generative property"" of language in human numeral cognition. Hockett (1966) details a list of features regarded as essential to describing human language. In the domain of the lexical-phonological principle, two features of this list are most important: The sound system of a language is composed of a finite set of simple phonological items

. By combining the atomic elements or ""features"" with which all humans are innately equipped, anyone may in principle generate the entire range of vowels and consonants to be found in any of the world's languages, whether past, present or future. The distinctive features are in this sense atomic components of a universal language. In recent years, the notion of an innate ""universal grammar"" underlying phonological variation has been called into question

Related to this is another essential feature of human language: lexical syntax, wherein pre-existing units are combined, giving rise to semantically novel or distinct lexical items.[This paragraph needs citation(s)] Certain elements of the lexical-phonological principl","According to the context, a striking feature of language is that ""anyone may in principle generate the entire range of vowels and consonants to be found in any of the world's languages, whether past, present or future"" by combining atomic elements or features with which all humans are innately equipped.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.0,"The LLM's answer is partially correct, as it correctly identifies the modality-independent aspect of language. However, it fails to accurately capture the other features mentioned in the context, such as the ability to generate all the vowels and consonants or the innate innateness of language elements."
Are sign languages of the deaf independently invented?,true,". Should an impaired child be prevented from hearing or producing sound, its innate capacity to master a language may equally find expression in signing. Sign languages of the deaf are independently invented and have all the major properties of spoken language except for the modality of transmission. From this it appears that the language centres of the human brain must have evolved to function optimally, irrespective of the selected modality

. There are also, of course, many sign languages in existence, commonly associated with deaf communities; as noted above, these are equal in complexity, sophistication, and expressive power, to any oral language. The main difference is that the ""phonemes"" are produced on the outside of the body, articulated with hands, body, and facial expression, rather than inside the body articulated with tongue, teeth, lips, and breathing

. These sign languages are equal in complexity, sophistication, and expressive power, to any oral language. The cognitive functions are similar and the parts of the brain used are similar. The main difference is that the ""phonemes"" are produced on the outside of the body, articulated with hands, body, and facial express","Yes, according to the context, sign languages of the deaf are independently invented.",1.0,1.0,0.8,1.0,0.0,The LLM correctly identifies the context and correctly identifies the claim as true.
What is unique to humans compared to other animals?,Humans can lose one modality (e.g. hearing) and make up for this deficit by communicating with complete competence in a different modality (i.e. signing),". Highly social mammals such as primates and elephants have been known to exhibit traits that were once thought to be uniquely human, like empathy and altruism. Humanity's closest living relatives are common chimpanzees and bonobos. These primates share a common ancestor with humans who lived four to six million years ago. It is for this reason that chimpanzees and bonobos are viewed as the best available surrogate for this common ancestor

. Comparing a given gene with that of other species enables geneticists to determine whether it is rapidly evolving in humans alone. For example, while human DNA is on average 98% identical to chimp DNA, the so-called Human Accelerated Region 1 (HAR1), involved in the development of the brain, is only 85% similar

... is not the claim that such features do not appear elsewhere; the genetic structure of the human species makes such a possibility unlikely to the extreme.

. Notably, humans evolved in a qu","Based on the context, there is no specific trait mentioned that is unique to humans compared to other animals. The passage suggests that certain features, such as empathy and altruism, are not exclusive to humans and can be found in other social mammals like primates and elephants. Additionally, it is stated that ""no single trait is likely to have been unique"" to humans.",0.5,0.7,0.6,0.8,0.9,"The passage focuses on the ability of highly social mammals to exhibit traits that were once thought to be uniquely human, such as empathy and altruism. While these traits are mentioned as shared characteristics between humans and their closest living relatives, the passage does not provide any specific evidence or examples to support this claim. Additionally, it suggests that the ability to communicate through a different modality can compensate for the loss of a sensory modality."
What does modality independence refer to in animal communication?,The idea that a message and its modality (the way it is conveyed) cannot be separated.,". For example, no vocally-impaired whale, dolphin, or songbird could express its song repertoire equally in visual display. Indeed, in the case of animal communication, message and modality are not capable of being disentangled. Whatever message is being conveyed stems from the intrinsic properties of the signal. Modality independence should not be confused with the ordinary phenomenon of multimodality

. ""The detachment from modality-specific inputs may represent a substantial change in neural organization, one that affects not only imitation but also communication; only humans can lose one modality (e.g. hearing) and make up for this deficit by communicating with complete competence in a different modality (i.e. signing)."" Animal communication systems routinely combine visible with audible properties and effects, but none is modality-independent

. The human linguistic property of modality independence is conceptually distinct from polymodality. It allows the speaker to encode the informational content of a message in a single channel whilst switching between channels as necessary. Modern city-dwellers switch effortlessly between the spoken word and writing in its various forms –","According to the context, modality independence in animal communication refers to the ability of an organism to express its message equally well in different modalities (e.g. visual display). However, it's important to note that this is not applicable to animals, as the passage states that ""message and modality are not capable of being disentangled"" in animal communication systems.",0.5,0.3,0.7,0.2,0.8,"The LLM's answer is factually correct, but it is not informative. It provides a general definition of modality independence, rather than discussing the specific concept in the context."
What is the characteristic of monkey and ape vocalizations?,Species-specific 'gesture-calls' inseparable from visual displays,". Primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable, but they remain reliable for the same reason—because they are hard to fake. Primate social intelligence is ""Machiavellian""—self-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples. Monkeys and apes often attempt to deceive each other, while at the same time remaining constantly on guard against falling victim to deception themselves

. One notable finding is that nonhuman primates, including the other great apes, produce calls that are graded, as opposed to categorically differentiated, with listeners striving to evaluate subtle gradations in signallers' emotional and bodily states. Nonhuman apes seemingly find it extremely difficult to produce vocalisations in the absence of the corresponding emotional states

. Primates are known to make ""vocal calls"", and these calls are generated by circuits in the brainstem and limbic system. In the wild, the communication of vervet monkeys has been the most extensively studied. They are known to make up to ten different vocalizations.

What property allows a speaker to encode informational content in a single channel and switch between channels as necessary?,Modality independence,". The human linguistic property of modality independence is conceptually distinct from polymodality. It allows the speaker to encode the informational content of a message in a single channel whilst switching between channels as necessary. Modern city-dwellers switch effortlessly between the spoken word and writing in its various forms – handwriting, typing, email, etc. Whichever modality is chosen, it can reliably transmit the full message content without external assistance of any kind

. Then, when released from the taboo, these same individuals resume narrating stories by the fireside or in the dark, switching to pure sound without sacrifice of informational content. Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. Humans' first recourse is to encode their thoughts in sound – a method which depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus

. The human species' unprecedented use of the tongue, lips and other moveable parts seems to place speech in a quite separate category, making its evolutionary emergence an intriguing theoretical challenge in the eyes of many scholars. The term modality means the ch","According to the context, the property that allows a speaker to encode informational content in a single channel and switch between channels as necessary is called ""modality independence"".",0.8,0.6,0.7,0.5,0.0,"The LLM's answer is relevant to the question, but it is not as comprehensive as the ground truth answer. The LLM's answer focuses on the single property of modality independence, while the ground truth answer provides a more general definition."
"In some Australian Aboriginal cultures, what is traditionally restricted by certain individuals?",A silent (manually-signed) version of their language,". Australian Aboriginals living in the Central Desert, where the temperature can drop below freezing at night, have evolved the ability to reduce their core temperatures without shivering. The advent of agriculture has played a key role in the evolutionary history of humanity. Early farming communities benefited from new and comparatively stable sources of food, but were also exposed to new and initially devastating diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, and smallpox

. When talking on the telephone, for example, any accompanying facial or manual gestures, however natural to the speaker, are not strictly necessary. When typing or manually signing, conversely, there is no need to add sounds. In many Australian Aboriginal cultures, a section of the population – perhaps women observing a ritual taboo – traditionally restrict themselves for extended periods to a silent (manually-signed) version of their language

. This is accomplished by using the data the brain has at its access, which can be to use past experiences and memories to form a proper response.(pp 66–67)</ref> However, sometimes the brain fails to predict accurately which means that the mind perceives a false illustration.

What was the original function of the speech organs in primates?,For more basic bodily functions such as feeding and breathing,". The speech organs evolved in the first instance not for speech but for more basic bodily functions such as feeding and breathing. Nonhuman primates have broadly similar organs, but with different neural controls. Non-human apes use their highly-flexible, maneuverable tongues for eating but not for vocalizing. When an ape is not eating, fine motor control over its tongue is deactivated

. Many attempts have been made to explain scientifically how speech emerged in humans, although to date no theory has generated agreement. Non-human primates, like many other animals, have evolved specialized mechanisms for producing sounds for purposes of social communication. On the other hand, no monkey or ape uses its tongue for such purposes

. Two possible scenarios have been proposed for the development of language, one of which supports the gestural theory: The first perspective that language evolved from the calls of human ancestors seems logical because both humans and animals make sounds or cries. One evolutionary reason to refute this is that, anatomically, the centre that controls calls in monkeys and other animals is located in a completely different part of the brain than in humans

","According to the context, the original function of the speech organs in primates was not for speech, but for more basic bodily functions such as feeding and breathing.",0.8,0.6,0.7,0.5,0.9,"The answer provides a general overview of the original function of the speech organs, but it lacks specific details about the bodily functions."
What is the most important speech articulator in phonetics?,The tongue,". Either it is performing gymnastics with its tongue or it is vocalising; it cannot perform both activities simultaneously. Since this applies to mammals in general, Homo sapiens are exceptional in harnessing mechanisms designed for respiration and ingestion for the radically different requirements of articulate speech. The word ""language"" derives from the Latin lingua, ""tongue"". Phoneticians agree that the tongue is the most important speech articulator, followed by the lips

. The fine motor movements associated with the tongue and the airway, make humans more capable of producing a wide range of intricate shapes in order to produce sounds at different rates and intensities. In humans, the lips are important for the production of stops and fricatives, in addition to vowels. Nothing, however, suggests that the lips evolved for those reasons

. Speakers tend to minimise effort, favouring ease of articulation over clarity. Listeners do the opposite, favouring sounds that are easy to distinguish even if difficult to pronounce. Since speakers and listeners are constantly switching roles, the syllable systems actually found in the world's languages turn out to be a compromise between a","According to the context, the tongue is the most important speech articulator, followed by the lips.",0.5,0.7,0.8,0.3,0.6,"The LLM correctly identifies the tongue as one of the most important speech articulators, but its relevance and similarity scores are lower than those of the lips."
What is the shape of the human tongue compared to other mammals?,almost circular sagittal (midline) contour,". A natural language can be viewed as a particular way of using the tongue to express thought. The human tongue has an unusual shape. In most mammals, it is a long, flat structure contained largely within the mouth. It is attached at the rear to the hyoid bone, situated below the oral level in the pharynx. In humans, the tongue has an almost circular sagittal (midline) contour, much of it lying vertically down an extended pharynx, where it is attached to a hyoid bone in a lowered position

. Human tongues are a lot shorter and thinner than other mammals and are composed of a large number of muscles, which helps shape a variety of sounds within the oral cavity. The diversity of sound production is also increased with the human’s ability to open and close the airway, allowing varying amounts of air to exit through the nose

. Either it is performing gymnastics with its tongue or it is vocalising; it cannot perform both activities simultaneously. Since this applies to mammals in general, Homo sapiens are exceptional in harnessing mechanisms designed for respiration and ingestion for the radically different requirements of articulate speech.

What is the approximate ratio of cross-sectional area change that the human tongue can make in the horizontal and vertical tubes of the supralaryngeal vocal tract?,10:1,". Partly as a result of this, the horizontal (inside-the-mouth) and vertical (down-the-throat) tubes forming the supralaryngeal vocal tract (SVT) are almost equal in length (whereas in other species, the vertical section is shorter). As humans move their jaws up and down, the tongue can vary the cross-sectional area of each tube independently by about 10:1, altering formant frequencies accordingly

. As against this, Philip Lieberman points out that only humans have evolved permanent and substantial laryngeal descent in association with hyoidal descent, resulting in a curved tongue and two-tube vocal tract with 1:1 proportions. Uniquely in the human case, simple contact between the epiglottis and velum is no longer possible, disrupting the normal mammalian separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts during swallowing

. However, laryngeal descent in nonhumans (according to Philip Lieberman) is not accompanied by descent of the hyoid; hence the tongue remains horizontal in the oral cavity, preventing it from acting as a pharyngeal articulator. Despite all this, scholars remain divided as to how ""special"" the human vocal tract really is. It has been shown that the larynx does ","According to the context, the human tongue can vary the cross-sectional area of each tube independently by about 10:1.",0.75,0.85,0.7,0.6,0.8,"The LLM provides a correct answer, but its relevance is low due to the lack of specific details about the tongue's ability to change the cross-sectional area of the vocal tract."
What three vowels can humans pronounce because their tubes are joined at a right angle?,"[i], [u] and [a]",". That the tubes are joined at a right angle permits pronunciation of the vowels [i], [u] and [a], which nonhuman primates cannot do. Even when not performed particularly accurately, in humans the articulatory gymnastics needed to distinguish these vowels yield consistent, distinctive acoustic results, illustrating the quantal[clarification needed] nature of human speech sounds. It may not be coincidental that [i], [u] and [a] are the most common vowels in the world's languages

What is suggested not to be the reason for the evolution of human lips?,"production of stops and fricatives, in addition to vowels",". Hence, according to Ann MacLarnon, ""the evolution of mobile, muscular lips, so important to human speech, was the exaptive result of the evolution of diurnality and visual communication in the common ancestor of haplorhines"". It is unclear whether human lips have undergone a more recent adaptation to the specific requirements of speech

In humans, the lips are important for the production of stops and fricatives, in addition to vowels. Nothing, however, suggests that the lips evolved for those reasons

. Supporting this model is also its ability to explain unique human phenomena, such as the use of intonations when converting words into commands and questions, the tendency of infants to mimic vocalizations during the first year of life (and its disappearance later on) and the protruding and visible human lips, which are not found in other apes. This theory could be considered an elaboration of the putting-down-the-baby theory of language evolution

What happened to the snout during primate evolution?,It became reduced,". During primate evolution, a shift from nocturnal to diurnal activity in tarsiers, monkeys and apes (the haplorhines) brought with it an increased reliance on vision at the expense of olfaction. As a result, the snout became reduced and the rhinarium or ""wet nose"" was lost. The muscles of the face and lips consequently became less constrained, enabling their co-option to serve purposes of facial expression. The lips also became thicker, and the oral cavity hidden behind became smaller

. Solidified footprints dated to about 350 ka and associated with H. heidelbergensis were found in southern Italy in 2003. H. sapiens lost the brow ridges from their hominid ancestors as well as the snout completely, though their noses evolve to be protruding (possibly from the time of H. erectus). By 200 ka, humans had stopped their brain expansion

. This suggests that the ancestral hominoid once lived throughout a vast area and as the Earth's climate and ecosystems changed, the ancestral hominoids ultimately became geographically isolated from one another.

What is a notable difference between human breathing control and that of nonhuman primates?,"Humans have significantly enhanced control of breathing, enabling exhalations to be extended and inhalations shortened as we speak.",". Compared with nonhuman primates, humans have significantly enhanced control of breathing, enabling exhalations to be extended and inhalations shortened as we speak. Whilst we are speaking, intercostal and interior abdominal muscles are recruited to expand the thorax and draw air into the lungs, and subsequently to control the release of air as the lungs deflate. The muscles concerned are markedly more innervated in humans than in nonhuman primates

. The speech organs evolved in the first instance not for speech but for more basic bodily functions such as feeding and breathing. Nonhuman primates have broadly similar organs, but with different neural controls. Non-human apes use their highly-flexible, maneuverable tongues for eating but not for vocalizing. When an ape is not eating, fine motor control over its tongue is deactivated

. Human runners differ from quadrupeds in that while running they employ several phase-locked patterns (4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 5:2, and 3:2), although a 2:1 coupling ratio appears to be favored. Even though the evolution of bipedal gait has reduced the mechanical constraints on respiration in man, thereby permitting greater flexibility in breathing patter","According to the context, a notable difference between human breathing control and that of nonhuman primates is that humans have significantly enhanced control of breathing, enabling exhalations to be extended and inhalations shortened as we speak.",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.8,0.0,The LLM correctly identifies the key difference between human and nonhuman breathing control as the ability to extend and shorten inhalations and exhalations during speech.
What is the position of the larynx or voice box compared to other primates in humans?,lower,". This is because the evolution of humans to an upright position shifted the head directly above the spinal cord, forcing everything else downward.

"What has evolved permanently in humans, but not in other animals?",Laryngeal descent,"... is not the claim that such features do not appear elsewhere; the genetic structure of the human species makes such a possibility unlikely to the extreme. There may be uniqueness in combinations of traits, but no single trait is likely to have been unique in a particular part of the world although it might appear to be so because of the incomplete sampling provided by the spotty human fossil record

. Therefore, the evidence obtained so far is inconclusive as to what extent different human populations have undergone different amounts of adaptive evolution. The rate of adaptive evolution in the human genome has often been assumed to be constant over time. For example, the 35% estimate for α calculated by Fay et al. (2001) led them to conclude that there was one adaptive substitution in the human lineage every 200 years since human divergence from old-world monkeys

Do most specialists credit the Neanderthals with speech abilities not radically different from those of modern Homo sapiens?,True,". In response to the objection that the larynx is descended in human females, Fitch suggests that mothers vocalising to protect their infants would also have benefited from this ability. Most specialists credit the Neanderthals with speech abilities not radically different from those of modern Homo sapiens. An indirect line of argument is that their toolmaking and hunting tactics would have been difficult to learn or execute without some kind of speech

. Some researchers, applying auditory bioengineering models to computerised tomography scans of Neanderthal skulls, have asserted that Neanderthals had auditory capacity very similar to that of anatomically modern humans. These researchers claim that this finding implies that ""Neanderthals evolved the auditory capacities to support a vocal communication system as efficient as modern human speech.""

The human variant of the FOXP2 gene (linked to the control of speech) has been found to be identical in Neanderthals. Divergence of Neanderthal and Denisovan lineages from a common ancestor

. A recent extraction of DNA from Neanderthal bones indicates that Neanderthals had the same version of the FOXP2 gene as modern humans. This gene, mistakenly described as the ""grammar gene"", plays a role in controlling the orofacial movements which (in modern humans) are involved in speech. During the 1970s, it was widely believed that the Neanderthals lacked modern speech capacities

. According to the authors of the study, the observed excess of genetic similarity is best explained by recent gene flow from Neanderthals to modern humans after the migration out of Africa. But gene flow did not go one way. The fact that some of the ancestors of modern humans in Europe migrated back into Africa means that modern Africans also carry some genetic materials from Neanderthals. In part",The answer is FOXP2.,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,The LLM correctly identifies the FOXP2 gene as a gene with a similar sequence between Neanderthals and modern humans.
What is the function of the hyoid bone?,"It allows a wide range of tongue, pharyngeal and laryngeal movements",". It was claimed that they possessed a hyoid bone so high up in the vocal tract as to preclude the possibility of producing certain vowel sounds. The hyoid bone is present in many mammals. It allows a wide range of tongue, pharyngeal and laryngeal movements by bracing these structures alongside each other in order to produce variation

. Establishing distinct larynx positions through fossil remains of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals would support this theory; however, modern research has revealed that the hyoid bone was indistinguishable in the two populations. Though research has shown a lower sitting larynx is important to producing speech, another theory states it may not be as important as once thought

. The discovery of a modern-looking hyoid bone of a Neanderthal man in the Kebara Cave in Israel led its discoverers to argue that the Neanderthals had a descended larynx, and thus human-like speech capabilities. However, other researchers have claimed that the morphology of the hyoid is not indicative of the larynx's position. It is necessary to take into consideration the skull base, the mandible, the cervical vertebrae and a cranial reference plane

The hypothesis of pathological dwarfism, however, fails to explain additional anatomical features that are unlike those of modern humans (diseased or not) but much like those of ancient members of our genus. Aside from cranial features, these features include the form of bones in the wrist, forearm, shoulder, knees, and feet

--- # Human evolution Homo sapiens is a distinct species of the hominid family of primates, which also includes all the great apes. Over their evolutionary history, humans gradually developed traits such as bipedalism, dexterity, and complex language, as well as interbreeding with other hominins (a tribe of the African hominid subfamily), indicating that human evolution was not linear but weblike

What is the role of the hypoglossal nerve?,It plays an important role in controlling movements of the tongue,". The hypoglossal nerve, which passes through the hypoglossal canal, controls the movements of the tongue, which may have enabled voicing for size exaggeration (see size exaggeration hypothesis below) or may reflect speech abilities. However, although Neanderthals may have been anatomically able to speak, Richard G. Klein in 2004 doubted that they possessed a fully modern language. He largely bases his doubts on the fossil record of archaic humans and their stone tool kit

. The morphology of the outer and middle ear of Middle Pleistocene hominins from Atapuerca, Spain, believed to be proto-Neanderthal, suggests they had an auditory sensitivity similar to modern humans and very different from chimpanzees. They were probably able to differentiate between many different speech sounds. The hypoglossal nerve plays an important role in controlling movements of the tongue

What did researchers use to estimate the relative number of nerve fibers in fossil skulls?,The size of the hypoglossal canal,". In 1998, a research team used the size of the hypoglossal canal in the base of fossil skulls in an attempt to estimate the relative number of nerve fibres, claiming on this basis that Middle Pleistocene hominins and Neanderthals had more fine-tuned tongue control than either Australopithecines or apes

. The study found that there was a distinction necessary between growth time and growth rate. The times of growth were strikingly similar, but the rates were not. The paper further advocates the use of fossils to assess brain size in general and in relation to cranial capacity. Utilization of endocranial volume as a measure for brain size has been a popular methodology with the fossil record since Darwin in the mid 1800s

. The field of evolutionary neuroscience has been shaped by the development of new techniques that allow for the discovery and examination of parts of the nervous system. In 1873, C. Golgi devised the silver nitrate method which allowed for the description of the brain at the cellular level as opposed to simply the gross level. Santiago and Pedro Ramon used this method to analyze numerous parts of brains, broadening the field of comparative neuroanatomy

However","According to the context, researchers used the size of the hypoglossal canal in the base of fossil skulls to estimate the relative number of nerve fibers.",0.7,0.6,0.8,0.5,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the hypoglossal canal as a potential indicator of nerve fiber count, but its relevance is somewhat lower due to the context being rather specific and lacking additional information about the fossil skulls."
What is the current understanding regarding the correlation between hypoglossal canal size and nerve sizes in relation to human speech evolution?,They are not correlated.,". Subsequently, however, it was demonstrated that hypoglossal canal size and nerve sizes are not correlated, and it is now accepted that such evidence is uninformative about the timing of human speech evolution. According to one influential school, the human vocal apparatus is intrinsically digital on the model of a keyboard or digital computer[clarification needed] (see below)

When did the transition from an analog to a digital structure and function occur in human evolution?,"The context does not specify the exact timing of this transition, leaving it as an open question.",". Nothing about a chimpanzee's vocal apparatus suggests a digital keyboard[clarification needed], notwithstanding the anatomical and physiological similarities. This poses the question as to when and how, during the course of human evolution, the transition from analog to digital structure and function occurred

. According to some anthropologists, the transition to behavioral modernity with the development of symbolic culture, language, and specialized lithic technology happened around 50,000 years ago (beginning of the Upper Paleolithic), although others point to evidence of a gradual change over a longer time span during the Middle Paleolithic. Homo sapiens is the only extant species of its genus, Homo

. Debate continues as to whether a ""revolution"" led to modern humans (""big bang of human consciousness""), or whether the evolution was more gradual. Until about 50,000–40,000 years ago, the use of stone tools seems to have progressed stepwise. Each phase (H. habilis, H. ergaster, H. neanderthalensis) marked a new technology, followed by very slow development until the next phase.

What is the human supralaryngeal tract said to be like?,digital,". The human supralaryngeal tract is said to be digital in the sense that it is an arrangement of moveable toggles or switches, each of which, at any one time, must be in one state or another. The vocal cords, for example, are either vibrating (producing a sound) or not vibrating (in silent mode). By virtue of simple physics, the corresponding distinctive feature – in this case, ""voicing"" – cannot be somewhere in between. The options are limited to ""off"" and ""on""

. Partly as a result of this, the horizontal (inside-the-mouth) and vertical (down-the-throat) tubes forming the supralaryngeal vocal tract (SVT) are almost equal in length (whereas in other species, the vertical section is shorter). As humans move their jaws up and down, the tongue can vary the cross-sectional area of each tube independently by about 10:1, altering formant frequencies accordingly

. As against this, Philip Lieberman points out that only humans have evolved permanent and substantial laryngeal descent in association with hyoidal descent, resulting in a curved tongue and two-tube vocal tract with 1:1 proportions. He argues that Neanderthals and early anatomically modern humans could not have possessed supral","According to the context, the human supralaryngeal tract is said to be ""digital"" in nature, meaning it is an arrangement of moveable toggles or switches, with each part (such as the vocal cords) being either on or off.",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.7,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the concept of the human supralaryngeal tract as being digital in nature, with the vocal cords being an example of a movable toggle."

Equally digital is the feature known as ""nasalisation"". At any given moment the soft palate or velum either allows or does not allow sound to resonate in the nasal chamber. In the case of lip and tongue positions, more than two digital states may be allowed. The theory that speech sounds are composite entities constituted by complexes of binary phonetic features was first advanced in 1938 by the Russian linguist Roman Jakobson

. A prominent early supporter of this approach was Noam Chomsky, who went on to extend it from phonology to language more generally, in particular to the study of syntax and semantics. In his 1965 book, Aspects of the Theory of Syntax, Chomsky treated semantic concepts as combinations of binary-digital atomic elements explicitly on the model of distinctive features theory. The lexical item ""bachelor"", on this basis, would be expressed as [+ Human], [+ Male], [- Married]

What is the main focus of the iterated learning model?,Transmission from generation to generation,". Agent-based computer models take the perspective of self-organisation at the level of the speech community or population. The two main paradigms are (1) the iterated learning model and (2) the language game model. Iterated learning focuses on transmission from generation to generation, typically with just one agent in each generation. In the language game model, a whole population of agents simultaneously produce, perceive and learn language, inventing novel forms when the need arises

""Through repeated interactions"", according to de Boer, ""vowel systems emerge that are very much like the ones found in human languages"". In a different model, the phonetician Björn Lindblom was able to predict, on self-organisational grounds, the favoured choices of vowel systems ranging from three to nine vowels on the basis of a principle of optimal perceptual differentiation

. For example, models elaborated by Berrah et al. (1996) and de Boer (2000), and recently reformulated using Bayesian theory, showed how a group of individuals playing imitation games can self-organise repertoires of vowel sounds which share substantial properties with human vowel systems. For example, in de Boer's model, initially vowels are generated randomly, but agents learn from each other as they interact repeatedly over time

. By combining the atomic elements or ""features"" with which all humans are innately equipped, anyone may in principle generate the entire range of vowels and consonants to be found in any of the world's languages, whether past, present or future. The distinctive features are in this sense atomic components of a universal language. In recent years, the notion of an innate ""univ",One of the principles that can be used to predict the emergence of vowel systems is a principle of optimal perceptual differentiation.,0.8,0.6,0.7,0.4,0.0,The LLM failed to provide a clear and concise explanation of why optimal perceptual differentiation is a principle that can be used to predict the emergence of vowel systems.
What is the term referred to as 'combining phonemes to build structured syllables'?,Phonemic coding,". Further models studied the role of self-organisation in the origins of phonemic coding and combinatoriality, which is the existence of phonemes and their systematic reuse to build structured syllables

. Under the specific phonotactic rules of a given language, these items can be recombined and concatenated, giving rise to morphology and the open-ended lexicon. A key feature of language is that a simple, finite set of phonological items gives rise to an infinite lexical system wherein rules determine the form of each item, and meaning is inextricably linked with form. Phonological syntax, then, is a simple combination of pre-existing phonological units

. Once individuals became capable of producing a sequence of calls, this allowed multi-syllabic words, which increased the size of their vocabulary (illustration part 7). The use of words, composed of sequences of syllables, provided the infrastructure for communicating with sequences of words (i.e. sentences). The theory's name is derived from the two auditory streams, which are both found in the brains of humans and other primates

. There is new[when?] evidence to suggest that Campbell's monkeys also display lexical syntax, com","Based on the context, the answer would be ""phonemic coding and combinatoriality"".",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.8,"The answer is somewhat relevant, but it does not accurately capture the exact meaning of the phrase. It should have mentioned 'combining phonemes to build structured syllables' directly."
Who developed models that showed basic neural equipment for adaptive holistic vocal imitation?,Pierre-Yves Oudeyer,". Pierre-Yves Oudeyer developed models which showed that basic neural equipment for adaptive holistic vocal imitation, coupling directly motor and perceptual representations in the brain, can generate spontaneously shared combinatorial systems of vocalisations, including phonotactic patterns, in a society of babbling individuals

. Several models have shown how relatively simple peer-to-peer vocal interactions, such as imitation, can spontaneously self-organise a system of sounds shared by the whole population, and different in different populations. For example, models elaborated by Berrah et al

. This has led to suggestions that human language evolved from a gesture performance/understanding system implemented in mirror neurons. Mirror neurons have been said to have the potential to provide a mechanism for action-understanding, imitation-learning, and the simulation of other people's behavior. This hypothesis is supported by some cytoarchitectonic homologies between monkey premotor area F5 and human Broca's area

"According to the text, what is the original system that gave rise to human speech?",a system that was originally gestural,". Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as we know it emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of Homo sapiens. A development as complex as the reconfiguration of the human vocal tract would have required much more time, implying an early date of origin. This discrepancy in timescales undermines the idea that human vocal flexibility was initially driven by selection pressures for speech

. I cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man's own instinctive cries. In 1861, historical linguist Max Müller published a list of speculative theories concerning the origins of spoken language: Most scholars today consider all such theories not so much wrong—they occasionally offer peripheral insights—as naïve and irrelevant

. --- # Origin of speech The origin of speech differs from the origin of language because language is not necessarily spoken; it could equally be written or signed. Speech is a fundamental aspect of human communication and plays a vital role in the everyday lives of humans. It ","According to the context, the original system that gave rise to human speech was likely imitation and modification of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man's own instinctive cries. This process was aided by signs and gestures.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.0,"The LLM provides a reasonable description of how the original system that gave rise to human speech could have been gestural, but it lacks specific details and focuses more on the acoustic aspects of speech."
What is the basis of both spoken language and signing?,Similar neural structures,". These sign languages are equal in complexity, sophistication, and expressive power, to any oral language. The cognitive functions are similar and the parts of the brain used are similar. The main difference is that the ""phonemes"" are produced on the outside of the body, articulated with hands, body, and facial expression, rather than inside the body articulated with tongue, teeth, lips, and breathing. (Compare the motor theory of speech perception

. Human ancestors were unable to control their vocalisation at the time when gestures were used to communicate; however, as they slowly began to control their vocalisations, spoken language began to evolve. Research has found strong support for the idea that spoken language and signing depend on similar neural structures

. And, as exemplified by the finches, such de-differentiations can occur in very rapid time-frames. A distinction can be drawn between speech and language. Language is not necessarily spoken: it might alternatively be written or signed. Speech is among a number of different methods of encoding and transmitting linguistic information, albeit arguably[by whom?] the most natural one

What happens to patients who used sign language and suffered from a left-hemisphere lesion?,They show the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients do with their oral language,". Patients who used sign language, and who suffered from a left-hemisphere lesion, showed the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients did with their oral language. Other researchers found that the same left-hemisphere brain regions were active during sign language as during the use of vocal or written language

. Patients who used sign language, and who suffered from a left-hemisphere lesion, showed the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients did with their oral language. Other researchers found that the same left-hemisphere brain regions were active during sign language as during the use of vocal or written language. Humans spontaneously use hand and facial gestures when formulating ideas to be conveyed in speech

. Only in humans (in the left hemisphere) is it also responsible for other processes associated with language use and acquisition, such as speech repetition and production, integration of phonemes with their lip movements, perception and production of intonations, phonological long-term memory (long-term memory storage of the sounds of words), and phonological working memory (the temporary storage of the sounds of words). Some evidence",Patients who used sign language and suffered from a left-hemisphere lesion showed the same disorders with their sign language as vocal patients did with their oral language.,1.0,0.8,0.75,0.5,0.0,"The answer is factually correct, but it does not provide any context or insights into the specific cognitive processes involved in sign language interpretation and the effects of a left-hemisphere lesion."
What are the primary means by which sign languages produce phonemes?,"hands, body, and facial expression",". There are also, of course, many sign languages in existence, commonly associated with deaf communities; as noted above, these are equal in complexity, sophistication, and expressive power, to any oral language. The main difference is that the ""phonemes"" are produced on the outside of the body, articulated with hands, body, and facial expression, rather than inside the body articulated with tongue, teeth, lips, and breathing

What is one piece of evidence that supports the theory that mirror neurons are a factor in the evolution of speech?,The presence of mirror neurons in primates,". Many psychologists and scientists have looked into the mirror system in the brain to answer this theory as well as other behavioural theories. Evidence to support mirror neurons as a factor in the evolution of speech includes mirror neurons in primates, the success of teaching apes to communicate gesturally, and pointing/gesturing to teach young children language

. This has led to suggestions that human language evolved from a gesture performance/understanding system implemented in mirror neurons. Mirror neurons have been said to have the potential to provide a mechanism for action-understanding, imitation-learning, and the simulation of other people's behavior. This hypothesis is supported by some cytoarchitectonic homologies between monkey premotor area F5 and human Broca's area

. A gradual change in acoustic properties, meaning, or both could have resulted in arbitrariness and an expanded repertoire of words. Humans have been increasingly exposed to TUS over millions of years, coinciding with the period during which spoken language evolved. In humans, functional MRI studies have reported finding areas homologous to the monkey mirror neuron system in the inferior frontal cort","One piece of evidence that supports the theory that mirror neurons are a factor in the evolution of speech is ""mirror neurons in primates"".",1.0,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the mention of mirror neurons in primates as evidence supporting the theory, but it does not provide any context or explanation for why mirror neurons are relevant to the evolution of speech."
What was the location of mirror neurons studied by Fogassi and Ferrari (2014)?,Area F5 in the Broca's area,". Fogassi and Ferrari (2014) monitored motor cortex activity in monkeys, specifically area F5 in the Broca’s area, where mirror neurons are located. They observed changes in electrical activity in this area when the monkey executed or observed different hand actions performed by someone else. Broca’s area is a region in the frontal lobe responsible for language production and processing

. Analysis of the data using Granger Causality revealed that the mirror-neuron system of the observer indeed reflects the pattern of activity of in the motor system of the sender, supporting the idea that the motor concept associated with the words is indeed transmitted from one brain to another using the mirror system. Not all linguists agree with the above arguments, however

. This has led to suggestions that human language evolved from a gesture performance/understanding system implemented in mirror neurons. Mirror neurons have been said to have the potential to provide a mechanism for action-understanding, imitation-learning, and the simulation of other people's behavior. This hypothesis is supported by some cytoarchitectonic homologies between monkey premotor area F5 and human Broca's area

.","According to the context, the location of mirror neurons studied by Fogassi and Ferrari (2014) is area F5 in the Broca's area, specifically in the motor cortex.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.0,"The LLM provides a good match for the ground truth answer, but it could be improved by providing more specific information about the role of mirror neurons in the motor cortex."
What region is involved in the discovery of mirror neurons?,The brain,". The discovery of mirror neurons in this region, which fire when an action is done or observed specifically with the hand, strongly supports the belief that communication was once accomplished with gestures. The same is true when teaching young children language

What is the best medium for encoding information for transmission over distances at speed for mammals?,Sound,". When one points at a specific object or location, mirror neurons in the child fire as though they were doing the action, which results in long-term learning Critics note that for mammals in general, sound turns out to be the best medium in which to encode information for transmission over distances at speed

. From this philosophical standpoint, animal communication cannot be digital because it does not have the luxury of being patently false. Costly signals of any kind can only be evaluated on an analog scale. Put differently, truly symbolic, digital signals become socially acceptable only under highly unusual conditions—such as those internal to a ritually bonded community whose members are not tempted to lie

. For example, no vocally-impaired whale, dolphin, or songbird could express its song repertoire equally in visual display. Indeed, in the case of animal communication, message and modality are not capable of being disentangled. Whatever message is being conveyed stems from the intrinsic properties of the signal. Modality independence should not be confused with the ordinary phenomenon of multimodality

. That is, in order to be taken seriously, each signal it emits must ","According to the context, sound is the best medium for encoding information for transmission over distances at speed for mammals.",0.8,0.5,0.7,0.2,0.0,"The passage does not explicitly state that sound is the best medium for encoding information for transmission over distances at speed for mammals, which is why it receives a low score in this category."
What factor may have led early humans to abandon sound-based communication methods?,The competing demands of manual gesturing,". Given the probability that this applied also to early humans, it is hard to see why they should have abandoned this efficient method in favour of more costly and cumbersome systems of visual gesturing – only to return to sound at a later stage. By way of explanation, it has been proposed that at a relatively late stage in human evolution, hands became so much in demand for making and using tools that the competing demands of manual gesturing became a hindrance

. The transition to spoken language is said to have occurred only at that point. Since humans throughout evolution have been making and using tools, however, most scholars remain unconvinced by this argument. (For a different approach to this issue – one setting out from considerations of signal reliability and trust – see ""from pantomime to speech"" below). Recent insights in human evolution – more specifically, human Pleistocene littoral evolution – may help understand how human speech evolved

. Cataldo, Migliano, and Vinicius report speech alone appears inadequate for transmitting stone tool-making knowledge, and suggest that speech may have emerged due to an increase in complex social interactions. Steven Mithen propos","According to the context, no factor is mentioned as leading early humans to abandon sound-based communication methods. In fact, it states that ""it is hard to see why they should have abandoned this efficient method"" (referring to sound-based communication).

What is the argument that most scholars remain unconvinced by regarding the transition to spoken language?,The idea that humans only made and used tools before developing spoken language,". A criticism of all this is that while grammaticalization theory might explain language change today, it does not satisfactorily address the really difficult challenge—explaining the initial transition from primate-style communication to language as it is known today. Rather, the theory assumes that language already exists

. Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as we know it emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of Homo sapiens.

However, the explanation is not relevant to the question and does not provide new insights into the topic."
What type of environment is believed to have contributed to the evolution of pre-adaptations for spoken language?,River banks and lake shores rich in fatty acids and other brain-specific nutrients,". One controversial suggestion is that certain pre-adaptations for spoken language evolved during a time when ancestral hominins lived close to river banks and lake shores rich in fatty acids and other brain-specific nutrients. Occasional wading or swimming may also have led to enhanced breath-control (breath-hold diving)

What is a prerequisite for spoken language according to the context?,Voluntary airway control,". Then, when released from the taboo, these same individuals resume narrating stories by the fireside or in the dark, switching to pure sound without sacrifice of informational content. Speaking is the default modality for language in all cultures. Humans' first recourse is to encode their thoughts in sound – a method which depends on sophisticated capacities for controlling the lips, tongue and other components of the vocal apparatus

. Ultimately, there is some consensus within the field that a theory of mind is necessary for language use. Thus, the development of a full theory of mind in humans was a necessary precursor to full language use. In one particular study, rats and pigeons were required to press a button a certain number of times to get food. The animals showed very accurate distinction for numbers less than four, but as the numbers increased, the error rate increased

What is known about the timing of language's emergence in the human species?,Little,". The time range for the evolution of language or its anatomical prerequisites extends, at least in principle, from the phylogenetic divergence of Homo from Pan to the emergence of full behavioral modernity some 50,000–150,000 years ago. Few dispute that Australopithecus probably lacked vocal communication significantly more sophisticated than that of great apes in general, but scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since the appearance of Homo some 2.5 million years ago

."" Berwick and Chomsky therefore suggest language emerged approximately between 200,000 years ago and 60,000 years ago (between the appearance of the first anatomically modern humans in southern Africa and the last exodus from Africa respectively). ""That leaves us with about 130,000 years, or approximately 5,000–6,000 generations of time for evolutionary change. This is not 'overnight in one generation' as some have (incorrectly) inferred—but neither is it on the scale of geological eons

Is there direct linguistic evidence available to study human origins?,No,". Lacking direct linguistic evidence, specialists in human origins have resorted to the study of anatomical features and genes arguably associated with speech production. Whilst such studies may provide information as to whether pre-modern Homo species had speech capacities, it is still unknown whether they actually spoke. Whilst they may have communicated vocally, the anatomical and genetic data lack the resolution necessary to differentiate proto-language from speech

. Scholars wishing to study the origins of language draw inferences from evidence such as the fossil record, archaeological evidence, and contemporary language diversity. They may also study language acquisition as well as comparisons between human language and systems of animal communication (particularly other primates)

. Attempts to explain the origin of language take a variety of forms: Most linguistic scholars as of 2024[update] favor continuity-based theories, but they vary in how they hypothesize language development. Some among those who consider language as mostly innate avoid speculating about specific precursors in nonhuman primates, stressing simply that the language faculty must have evolved gradually
","No, according to the context, there is no direct linguistic evidence available to study human origins.",0.0,0.0,0.1,0.2,0.0,The context does not provide any direct linguistic evidence to support the claim that there is direct linguistic evidence available to study human origins.
When did linguist Johanna Nichols argue that vocal languages must have begun diversifying at least?,"100,000 years ago",". Using statistical methods to estimate the time required to achieve the current spread and diversity in modern languages, Johanna Nichols—a linguist at the University of California, Berkeley—argued in 1998 that vocal languages must have begun diversifying in the human species at least 100,000 years ago

What is the estimated time period when modern Homo sapiens expanded out of Africa?,around 60-70 thousand years ago,". sapiens that left Africa after that time. There were at least several ""out-of-Africa"" dispersals of modern humans, possibly beginning as early as 270,000 years ago, including 215,000 years ago to at least Greece, and certainly via northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula about 130,000 to 115,000 years ago. There is evidence that modern humans had reached China around 80,000 years ago

.[note 1] The recent African origin theory suggests that the anatomically modern humans outside of Africa descend from a population of Homo sapiens migrating from East Africa roughly 70–50,000 years ago and spreading along the southern coast of Asia and to Oceania by about 50,000 years ago.

What is one possible use of phonemic diversity in linguistics?,as a clock to calculate how long the oldest African languages would have been around,". ""Phonemic diversity"" denotes the number of perceptually distinct units of sound – consonants, vowels and tones – in a language. The current worldwide pattern of phonemic diversity potentially contains the statistical signal of the expansion of modern Homo sapiens out of Africa, beginning around 60-70 thousand years ago

. For example, Rotokas, a language of New Guinea, and Pirahã, spoken in South America, both have just 11 phonemes, whilst !Xun, a language spoken in Southern Africa has 141 phonemes. The authors use a natural experiment – the colonization of mainland Southeast Asia on the one hand, the long-isolated Andaman Islands on the other – to estimate the rate at which phonemic diversity increases through time

. They argue that the actual distribution of phonemic diversity in the world reflects recent language contact and not deep language history - since it is well demonstrated that languages can lose or gain many phonemes over very short periods. In other words, there is no valid linguistic reason to expect genetic founder effects to influence phonemic diversity

. Some scholars argue that phonemic diversity evolves slowly and can be used as a clock to calculate how long","One possible use of phonemic diversity in linguistics is as a ""clock"" to estimate the time elapsed since a language or group of languages expanded out of Africa, potentially providing evidence for the migration of modern Homo sapiens.",0.8,0.5,0.7,0.2,0.8,"The LLM correctly identifies the concept of phonemic diversity in linguistics, but the provided context is not relevant to this concept.

"How many phonemes does !Xun, spoken in Southern Africa, have?",141,". For example, Rotokas, a language of New Guinea, and Pirahã, spoken in South America, both have just 11 phonemes, whilst !Xun, a language spoken in Southern Africa has 141 phonemes. The authors use a natural experiment – the colonization of mainland Southeast Asia on the one hand, the long-isolated Andaman Islands on the other – to estimate the rate at which phonemic diversity increases through time

. The survey revealed that African languages had the largest number of phonemes, and Oceania and South America had the smallest number. After allowing for the number of speakers, the phonemic diversity was compared to over 2000 possible origin locations. Atkinson's ""best fit"" model is that language originated in western, central, or southern Africa between 80,000 and 160,000 years ago.

What is the estimated time period when the world's languages emerged?,Between 350 thousand and 150 thousand years ago,". Using this rate, they estimate that the world's languages date back to the Middle Stone Age in Africa, sometime between 350 thousand and 150 thousand years ago. This corresponds to the speciation event which gave rise to Homo sapiens

."" Berwick and Chomsky therefore suggest language emerged approximately between 200,000 years ago and 60,000 years ago (between the appearance of the first anatomically modern humans in southern Africa and the last exodus from Africa respectively). ""That leaves us with about 130,000 years, or approximately 5,000–6,000 generations of time for evolutionary change. This is not 'overnight in one generation' as some have (incorrectly) inferred—but neither is it on the scale of geological eons

. Estimates of this kind are not universally accepted, but jointly considering genetic, archaeological, palaeontological, and much other evidence indicates that language likely emerged somewhere in sub-Saharan Africa during the Middle Stone Age, roughly contemporaneous with the speciation of Homo sapiens

What is one criticism linguists have against studies that compare the number of genes to the number of phonemes in languages?,That they are based on a flawed analogy between genes and phonemes,". These and similar studies have however been criticised by linguists who argue that they are based on a flawed analogy between genes and phonemes, since phonemes are frequently transferred laterally between languages unlike genes, and on a flawed sampling of the world's languages, since both Oceania and the Americas also contain languages with very high numbers of phonemes, and Africa contains languages with very few

. They argue that the actual distribution of phonemic diversity in the world reflects recent language contact and not deep language history - since it is well demonstrated that languages can lose or gain many phonemes over very short periods. In other words, there is no valid linguistic reason to expect genetic founder effects to influence phonemic diversity

. Another criticism has questioned the logic of the argument for single mutation and puts forward that from the formal simplicity of Merge, the capacity Berwick and Chomsky deem the core property of human language that emerged suddenly, one cannot derive the (number of) evolutionary steps that led to it

. For example, Rotokas, a language of New Guinea, and Pirahã, spoken in South America, both have just 11 phonemes, whilst !Xun, a language spoken in Southern Africa has 141 phonemes. The authors use a natural experiment – the colonization of mainland Southeast Asia on the one hand, the long-isolated Andaman Islands on the other – to estimate the rate at which phonemic diversity increases through time

. Some scholars argue that phonemic diversity evolves slowly and can be used as a clock to calculate how long","According to the context, recent language contact is argued to drive the distribution of phonemic diversity in languages, rather than deep language history or genetic founder effects.

What is a necessary condition for an adaptation to occur?,It must be evolvable.,". Additional information regarding these principles may be found in the table below. Adaptation works within constraints, makes compromises and trade-offs, and occurs in the context of different forms of competition. Adaptations can only occur if they are evolvable. Some adaptations which would prevent ill health are therefore not possible. Other constraints occur as the byproduct of adaptive innovations

. More specifically, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness is defined as the set of historically recurring selection pressures that formed a given adaptation, as well as those aspects of the environment that were necessary for the proper development and functioning of the adaptation. Humans, the genus Homo, appeared between 1.5 and 2.5 million years ago, a time that roughly coincides with the start of the Pleistocene 2.6 million years ago

In addition, adaptations are expected to be presented as proximate mechanisms that interact with the environment in either a generally obligate or facultative fashion (see abov","According to the context, a necessary condition for an adaptation to occur is that it must be evolvable.",1.0,0.9,0.8,0.7,1.0,The LLM correctly identifies the context requirement as 'evolvable' and correctly states that adaptations can only occur if they are evolvable.
What was the original way that humans lived?,as simple hunter-gatherers in small tribal bands,". Modern humans started burying their dead, making clothing from animal hides, hunting with more sophisticated techniques (such as using pit traps or driving animals off cliffs), and cave painting.

What is the primary focus of the discipline described in the context?,"single, materialistic— i.e., anatomical or structural (e.g., in genes and their products)— changes within the body",". Critics object that this view is reductionist and that cognitive specialisation only comes about through the interaction of humans with their real environment, rather than the environment of distant ancestors. Interdisciplinary approaches are increasingly striving to mediate between these opposing points of view and to highlight that biological and cultural causes need not be antithetical in explaining human behaviour and even complex cultural achievements

. In contrast, some academics argue that it is unnecessary to posit the existence of highly domain specific modules, and, suggest that the neural anatomy of the brain supports a model based on more domain general faculties and processes. Moreover, empirical support for the domain-specific theory stems almost entirely from performance on variations of the Wason selection task which is extremely limited in scope as it only tests one subtype of deductive reasoning

. The need for social intelligence surrounding theory of mind is a possible answer to the question as to why morality has evolved as a part of human behavior. Psychologist Matt J. Rossano muses that religion emerged after morality and built upon morality by expanding the social scrutiny of individual behavior to include supernatural third-party agents

Do all social animals have to modify or restrain their behaviors for group living?,Yes,". Being part of a group may also improve the chances of finding food. This is evident among animals that hunt in packs to take down large or dangerous prey. All social animals have hierarchical societies in which each member knows its own place. Social order is maintained by certain rules of expected behavior and dominant group members enforce order through punishment. Additionally, higher order primates also have a sense of fairness

. De Waal contends that all social animals have had to restrain or alter their behavior for group living to be worthwhile. Pre-moral sentiments evolved in primate societies as a method of restraining individual selfishness and building more cooperative groups. For any social species, the benefits of being part of an altruistic group should outweigh the benefits of individualism. For example, a lack of group cohesion could make individuals more vulnerable to attack from outsiders

. Social scientists have traditionally viewed morality as a construct, and thus as culturally relative, although others such as Sam Harris argue that there is an objective science of morality. Though other animals may not possess what humans may perceive as moral behavior, al","Yes, according to the context, all social animals have had to restrain or alter their behavior for group living to be worthwhile.",1.0,0.8,0.9,0.7,0.0,"The answer is correct, but it could be improved by providing more specific examples and by emphasizing the importance of individual agency in group living."
What is E.O. Wilson's argument for the key factor leading to the success of ant colonies?,The existence of a sterile worker caste,". Ant colonies may possess millions of individuals. E. O. Wilson argues that the single most important factor that leads to the success of ant colonies is the existence of a sterile worker caste. This caste of females are subservient to the needs of their mother, the queen, and in so doing, have given up their own reproduction in order to raise brothers and sisters

. In 1975, Edward O. Wilson combined evolutionary theory with studies of animal and social behavior, building on the works of Lorenz and Tinbergen, in his book Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. In the 1970s, two major branches developed from ethology. Firstly, the study of animal social behavior (including humans) generated sociobiology, defined by its pre-eminent proponent Edward O

What is the estimated time period when the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees/bonobos lived?,four to six million years ago,". According to the Chimpanzee Genome Project, the human–chimpanzee last common ancestor existed about five to six million years ago, assuming a constant rate of mutation. However, hominin species dated to earlier than the date could call this into question. Sahelanthropus tchadensis, commonly called ""Toumai"", is about seven million years old and Orrorin tugenensis lived at least six million years ago

. The chimpanzee–human divergence likely took place around 10 to 7 million years ago. The list of fossils begins with Graecopithecus, dated some 7.2 million years ago, which may or may not still be ancestral to both the human and the chimpanzee lineage.

What are some traits that primates exhibit which would have been necessary for the evolution of morality?,"High intelligence, a capacity for symbolic communication, a sense of social norms, realization of 'self', and a concept of continuity",". Barbara King argues that while primates may not possess morality in the human sense, they do exhibit some traits that would have been necessary for the evolution of morality. These traits include high intelligence, a capacity for symbolic communication, a sense of social norms, realization of ""self"", and a concept of continuity. Frans de Waal and Barbara King both view human morality as having grown out of primate sociality

For example, lack of group cohesion could make individuals more vulnerable to attack from outsiders. Being part of a group may also improve the chances of finding food. This is evident among animals that hunt in packs to take down large or dangerous prey. All social animals have societies in which each member knows its own place

. Humans may also have predispositions for ""altruistic punishment"" – to punish in-group members who violate in-group rules, even when this altruistic behavior cannot be justified in terms of helping those you are related to (kin selection), cooperating with those who you will interact with again (direct reciprocity), or cooperating to better your reputation with others (indirect reciprocity)

What is an example of how chimpanzees practice reciprocity?,Chimpanzees are more likely to share food with individuals who have previously groomed them.,". Social order is maintained by certain rules of expected behavior and dominant group members enforce order through punishment. However, higher order primates also have a sense of reciprocity. Chimpanzees remember who did them favors and who did them wrong. For example, chimpanzees are more likely to share food with individuals who have previously groomed them. Vampire bats also demonstrate a sense of reciprocity and altruism. They share blood by regurgitation, but do not share randomly

. They are most likely to share with other bats who have shared with them in the past or who are in dire need of feeding. Animals such as Capuchin monkeys and dogs also display an understanding of fairness, refusing to co-operate when presented unequal rewards for the same behaviors. Chimpanzees live in fission-fusion groups that average 50 individuals. It is likely that early ancestors of humans lived in groups of similar size

. Evolutionary psychology also recognizes the role of kin selection and reciprocity in evolving prosocial traits such as altruism. Like chimpanzees and bonobos, humans have subtle and flexible social instincts, allowing them to form extended families, lifelong friendships, ","According to the context, an example of how chimpanzees practice reciprocity is that they are more likely to share food with individuals who have previously groomed them.",0.7,0.8,0.6,0.9,0.8,"The LLM generated answer is correct, but it is not as relevant to the context as it should be.

What is positively selected by evolution according to the context?,Impunity,". The two alternative hypotheses are a relative absence of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN < dS; ω < 1), suggesting the effect on fitness ('fitness effect', or 'selection pressure') of such mutations is negative (purifying selection has operated over time); or a relative excess of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN > dS; ω > 1), indicating positive effect on fitness, i.e. diversifying selection (Yang and Bielawski 2000)

. Many authors, whose studies have small estimates of the amount of adaptive evolution in coding DNA, nevertheless accept that there has been some adaptive evolution in this DNA, because these studies identify specific regions within the human genome which have been evolving adaptively (e.g. Bakewell et al. (2007)). More genes underwent positive selection in chimpanzee evolution than in human

. However, more research is required to produce more accurate estimates of the average strength of positive selection in humans, which will in turn improve the estimates of the amount of adaptive evolution occurring in the human genome (Boyko et al. 2008). A considerable number of studies have used genomic methods to identify specific human genes that show evidence of adaptive e","According to the context, positively selected by evolution are genes or mutations with a positive effect on fitness, which indicates diversifying selection (ω > 1).

"According to the context, what was the original function of the brain according to the social brain hypothesis?",to process factual information,". Specifically punishing individuals aware of their breach of rules would select against the ability to be aware of it, precluding any coevolution of both conscious choice and a sense of it being the basis for moral and penal liability in the same species. The social brain hypothesis, detailed by R.I.M Dunbar in the article The Social Brain Hypothesis and Its Implications for Social Evolution, supports the fact that the brain originally evolved to process factual information

The cerebral neocortex is presumed to be responsible for the neural computations underlying complex phenomena such as perception, thought, language, attention, episodic memory and voluntary movement. According to Dunbar's theory, the relative neocortex size of any species correlates with the level of social complexity of the particular species. The neocortex size correlates with a number of social variables that include social group size and complexity of mating behaviors

What is the function of the neocortex in humans and primates?,It is responsible for reasoning and consciousness.,". The increase in volume of the neocortex also included a rapid increase in size of the cerebellum. Its function has traditionally been associated with balance and fine motor control, but more recently with speech and cognition. The great apes, including hominids, had a more pronounced cerebellum relative to the neocortex than other primates

Therefore, in social animals, the neocortex came under intense selection to increase in size to improve social cognitive abilities. Social animals, such as humans, are capable of two important concepts, coalition formation, or group living, and tactical deception, which is a tactic of presenting false information to others

What is a disadvantage of group living?,competition within the group for resources and mates,". Collectively, group living requires cooperation and generates conflict. Social living puts strong evolutionary selection pressures on acquiring social intelligence because living in groups has advantages. Such advantages include protection from predators and the fact that groups in general outperform the sum of an individual's performance. But, from an objective point of view, group living also has disadvantages, such as competition within the group for resources and mates

. For any social species, the benefits of being part of an altruistic group should outweigh the benefits of individualism. For example, lack of group cohesion could make individuals more vulnerable to attack from outsiders. Being part of a group may also improve the chances of finding food. This is evident among animals that hunt in packs to take down large or dangerous prey. All social animals have societies in which each member knows its own place

. While groups may benefit from avoiding certain behaviors, those harmful behaviors have the same effect regardless of whether the offending individuals are aware of them or not. Since the individuals themselves can increase their reproductive success by doing man","According to the context, a disadvantage of group living is that it generates competition within the group for resources and mates.",0.8,0.9,0.7,0.6,0.8,"The LLM's answer provides a correct description of a disadvantage of group living, but it could be improved by providing more context about the importance of cooperation and competition in group living."
What concept appears to be contradictory to evolutionary thought?,Altruism,".[page needed] However, their caution against committing the naturalistic fallacy has been criticized as means to stifle legitimate ethical discussions. Some criticisms of evolutionary psychology point at contradictions between different aspects of adaptive scenarios posited by evolutionary psychology

. Thus because there are a potentially infinite number of alternative explanations for why a trait evolved, critics contend that it is impossible to determine the exact explanation. While evolutionary psychology hypotheses are difficult to test, evolutionary psychologists assert that it is not impossible. Part of the critique of the scientific base of evolutionary psychology includes a critique of the concept of the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation (EEA)

. Some critics view evolutionary psychology as a form of genetic reductionism and genetic determinism, a common critique being that evolutionary psychology does not address the complexity of individual development and experience and fails to explain the influence of genes on behavior in individual cases

. Criticism of evolutionary psychology involves questions of testability, cognitive and evolutionary assumptions (such as mo","Based on the context, the concept that appears to be contradictory to evolutionary thought is the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation (EEA).",0.5,0.7,0.8,0.6,0.7,The context does not provide any information about the concept of the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation (EEA). The answer seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the term.
"What factor, according to E. Fehr, can account for the evolution of altruism?",Kin selection and inclusive fitness,". According to E. Fehr, in the article, The Nature of Human Altruism, the evolution of altruism can be accounted for when kin selection and inclusive fitness are taken into account; meaning reproductive success is not just dependent on the number of offspring an individual produces, but also the number of offspring that related individuals produce

. These theories help to explain the development of altruistic behavior, and account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism). Several mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The r/K selection theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring, while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy

. Evolutionary psychology also recognizes the role of kin selection and reciprocity in evolving prosocial traits such as altruism. Like chimpanzees and bonobos, humans have subtle and flexible social instincts, allowing them to form extended families, lifelong friendships, and political alliances

. Fitch argues, however, that the extended period of physical immaturity of human infants a","According to E. Fehr, kin selection and inclusive fitness can account for the evolution of altruism.",0.7,0.6,0.8,0.5,0.8,"The LLM generated answer provides the correct concepts, but it lacks depth and fails to capture the nuance of the term 'inclusive fitness'."
Who theorized the concept of the prisoner's dilemma?,John Nash,". Outside of familial relationships altruism is also seen, but in a different manner typically defined by the prisoner's dilemma, theorized by John Nash. The prisoner's dilemma serves to define cooperation and defecting with and against individuals driven by incentive, or in Nash's proposed case, years in jail

. In evolutionary terms, the best strategy to use for the prisoner's dilemma is tit-for-tat, where an individual should cooperate as long others are cooperating, and not defect until another individual defects against them. At their core, complex social interactions are driven by the need to distinguish sincere cooperation and defection. Brune details that theory of mind has been traced back to primates, but it is not observed to the extent that it is in the modern human

."" In 1993, Robert Frank and his associates found that participants in a prisoner's dilemma scenario were often able to predict whether their partners would ""cheat"", based on a half-hour of unstructured social interaction. In a 1996 experiment, for example, Linda Mealey and her colleagues found that people were better at remembering the faces of people when those faces were associated with stories about tho","According to the context, John Nash is credited with theorizing the concept of the prisoner's dilemma.",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.7,1.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the name of the person who theorized the concept of the prisoner's dilemma, but it provides no additional context or details about the theory itself."
When did theory of mind first appear in primates?,Not specified,". Moreover, Baron-Cohen argues that many primates show some, but not all, of these abilities. Call and Tomasello's research on chimpanzees supports this, in that individual chimps seem to understand that other chimps have awareness, knowledge, and intention, but do not seem to understand false beliefs. Many primates show some tendencies toward a theory of mind, but not a full one as humans have

. Ultimately, there is some consensus within the field that a theory of mind is necessary for language use. Thus, the development of a full theory of mind in humans was a necessary precursor to full language use. In one particular study, rats and pigeons were required to press a button a certain number of times to get food. The animals showed very accurate distinction for numbers less than four, but as the numbers increased, the error rate increased

. The emergence of this unique trait is perhaps where the divergence of the modern human begins, along with our acquisition of language. Humans use metaphors and imply much of what we say. Phrases such as, ""You know what I mean?"" are not uncommon and are direct results of the sophistication of the human theory of mind

. Although many scientist","According to the context, many primates show some tendencies toward a theory of mind, but not a full one as humans have. This is supported by research on chimpanzees, which suggests that individual chimps understand that other chimps have awareness, knowledge, and intention, but do not seem to understand false beliefs. Therefore, it can be inferred that the emergence of a full theory of mind in primates occurred at some point before the development of language in humans, but the exact timing is not specified in this context.",0.7,0.8,0.9,0.7,0.0,"The LLM's answer provides some relevant information about the development of theory of mind in primates, but it lacks depth and fails to accurately capture the nuances of the concept."
What is a unique trait that marks the divergence of modern humans?,The emergence of language,". sapiens about 70,000 years ago, was controversial from its first proposal in the 1990s and by the 2010s had very little support. Distinctive human genetic variability has arisen as the result of the founder effect, by archaic admixture and by recent evolutionary pressures. Since Homo sapiens separated from its last common ancestor shared with chimpanzees, human evolution is characterized by a number of morphological, developmental, physiological, behavioral, and environmental changes

... is not the claim that such features do not appear elsewhere; the genetic structure of the human species makes such a possibility unlikely to the extreme. There may be uniqueness in combinations of traits, but no single trait is likely to have been unique in a particular part of the world although it might appear to be so because of the incomplete sampling provided by the spotty human fossil record

What mental conditions are often associated with failure to understand another's intentions and emotions?,"Autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, some forms of dementia, and psychopathy",". Failure to understand another's intentions and emotions can yield inappropriate social responses and are often associated with human mental conditions such as autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, some forms of dementia, and psychopathy. This is especially true for autism spectrum disorders, where social disconnect is evident, but non-social intelligence can be preserved or even in some cases augmented, such as in the case of a savant

. The high rates of communicative disorders and psychopathy in males might facilitate their higher rates of disengagement from normative expectations and their insensitivity to social disapproval, when they deliberately do not follow social norms. Some of these speculations have yet to be developed into fully testable hypotheses, and a great deal of research is required to confirm their validity

. This ability is often related to theory of mind, or an awareness of the other as a being like the self with individual wants and intentions

"According to psychologist Matt J. Rossano, what emerged after morality?",Religion,". The need for social intelligence surrounding theory of mind is a possible answer to the question as to why morality has evolved as a part of human behavior. Psychologist Matt J. Rossano muses that religion emerged after morality and built upon morality by expanding the social scrutiny of individual behavior to include supernatural third-party agents

. Morality may have evolved in these bands of 100 to 200 people as a means of social control, conflict resolution and group solidarity. According to Dr. de Waal, human morality has two extra levels of sophistication that are not found in primate societies. Psychologist Matt J. Rossano argues that religion emerged after morality and built upon morality by expanding the social scrutiny of individual behavior to include supernatural agents

. By including ever-watchful ancestors, spirits and gods in the social realm, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups. The adaptive value of religion would have enhanced group survival. Rossano is referring here to collective religious belief and the social sanction that institutionalized morality. According to Rossano's teaching, indiv","According to the context, according to psychologist Matt J. Rossano, religion emerged after morality.",0.5,0.2,0.7,0.6,0.0,The LLM did not correctly identify that the correct answer is religion. It gave a lower score because it did not recognize the psychologist's context or the specific relationship between morality and religion.
What is one strategy humans discovered for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups?,"By including ever watchful ancestors, spirits and gods in the social realm",". By including ever watchful ancestors, spirits and gods in the social realm, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups. The adaptive value of religion would have enhanced group survival. In an experiment where subjects must demonstrate abstract, complex reasoning, researchers have found that humans (as has been seen in other animals) have a strong innate ability to reason about social exchanges

. De Waal contends that all social animals have had to restrain or alter their behavior for group living to be worthwhile. Pre-moral sentiments evolved in primate societies as a method of restraining individual selfishness and building more cooperative groups. For any social species, the benefits of being part of an altruistic group should outweigh the benefits of individualism. For example, a lack of group cohesion could make individuals more vulnerable to attack from outsiders

What emotion is believed to play an important role in certain forms of morality?,Disgust,". This ability is believed to be intuitive, since the logical rules do not seem to be accessible to the individuals for use in situations without moral overtones. Disgust, one of the basic emotions, may have an important role in certain forms of morality. Disgust is argued to be a specific response to certain things or behaviors that are dangerous or undesirable from an evolutionary perspective

. Although morality awareness may be a unique human trait, many social animals, such as primates, dolphins and whales, have been known to exhibit pre-moral sentiments

. Morality can be defined as a system of ideas about right and wrong conduct. In everyday life, morality is typically associated with human behavior rather than animal behavior. The emerging fields of evolutionary biology, and in particular evolutionary psychology, have argued that, despite the complexity of human social behaviors, the precursors of human morality can be traced to the behaviors of many other social animals. Sociobiological explanations of human behavior remain controversial

. The need for social intelligence surrounding theory of mind is a possible answer to the question as to why morality has evolved as a p",Disgust.,1.0,1.0,0.8,0.7,0.0,The LLM correctly identifies disgust as the emotion mentioned in the context.
What are some examples of stimuli that can elicit the emotion of disgust?,"Things that increase the risk of an infectious disease, and disgust against evolutionary disadvantageous mating",". One example is things that increase the risk of an infectious disease such as spoiled foods, dead bodies, other forms of microbiological decomposition, a physical appearance suggesting sickness or poor hygiene, and various body fluids such as feces, vomit, phlegm, and blood. Another example is disgust against evolutionary disadvantageous mating such as incest (the incest taboo) or unwanted sexual advances

. This ability is believed to be intuitive, since the logical rules do not seem to be accessible to the individuals for use in situations without moral overtones. Disgust, one of the basic emotions, may have an important role in certain forms of morality. Disgust is argued to be a specific response to certain things or behaviors that are dangerous or undesirable from an evolutionary perspective

. He found evidence that humans share at least five basic emotions: fear, sadness, happiness, anger, and disgust. Social emotions evidently evolved to motivate social behaviors that were adaptive in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.

What areas in the brain are activated by situations that threaten group cohesion or cooperation?,Areas associated with disgust,". Still another example are behaviors that may threaten group cohesion or cooperation such as cheating, lying, and stealing. MRI studies have found that such situations activate areas in the brain associated with disgust. --- # Evolutionary neuroscience Evolutionary neuroscience is the scientific study of the evolution of nervous systems. Evolutionary neuroscientists investigate the evolution and natural history of nervous system structure, functions and emergent properties

. Therefore, in social animals, the neocortex came under intense selection to increase in size to improve social cognitive abilities. Social animals, such as humans, are capable of two important concepts, coalition formation, or group living, and tactical deception, which is a tactic of presenting false information to others

. The cerebral neocortex is presumed to be responsible for the neural computations underlying complex phenomena such as perception, thought, language, attention, episodic memory and voluntary movement.

When did studies in evolutionary neuroscience begin?,1859,". Studies of the brain began during ancient Egyptian times but studies in the field of evolutionary neuroscience began after the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859. At that time, brain evolution was largely viewed at the time in relation to the incorrect scala naturae. Phylogeny and the evolution of the brain were still viewed as linear.

What were the principles based on which Darwinism was founded?,natural selection and variation,". Darwinism was based on the principles of natural selection and variation, Lamarckism was based on the passing down of acquired traits, Orthogenesis was based on the assumption that tendency towards perfection steers evolution, and Saltationism argued that discontinuous variation creates new species. Darwin's became the most accepted and allowed for people to starting thinking about the way animals and their brains evolve

. Evolutionary psychology focuses primarily on the ""why?"" questions, while traditional psychology focuses on the ""how?"" questions. Evolutionary psychology is founded on several core premises. Evolutionary psychology has its historical roots in Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. In The Origin of Species, Darwin predicted that psychology would develop an evolutionary basis: In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches

. The theories on which evolutionary psychology is based originated with Charles Darwin's work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humans. Modern evolutionary psychology, however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th century

What is believed to correlate with an increase in brain size?,an increase in neural centers and behavior complexity,". Increasing brain size has also been significant in human evolution. It began to increase approximately 2.4 million years ago, but modern levels of brain size were not attained until after 500,000 years ago. Zoological analyses have shown that the size of human brains is significantly larger than what anatomists would expect for their size. The human brain is three to four times larger than its closest relative, which is the chimpanzee

. The proposed increases in brain size from food processing will have led to a greater mental capacity for further cultural innovation in food processing which will have increased digestive efficiency further providing more energy for further gains in brain size. This positive feedback loop is argued to have led to the rapid brain size increases seen in the Homo lineage

How many archetypes did Cuvier believe in?,At least four,". St. Hilaire argued that all animals are built based on a single plan or archetype and he stressed the importance of homologies between organisms, while Cuvier believed that the structure of organs was determined by their function and that knowledge of the function of one organ could help discover the functions of other organs. He argued that there were at least four different archetypes. After Darwin, the idea of evolution was more accepted and St

. The debate in anthropology had swung in favour of monogenism by the mid-20th century. Isolated proponents of polygenism held forth in the mid-20th century, such as Carleton Coon, who thought as late as 1962 that H. sapiens arose five times from H. erectus in five places. The historical alternative to the recent origin model is the multiregional origin of modern humans, initially proposed by Milford Wolpoff in the 1980s

. According to Wolpoff, multiregionalism was misinterpreted by William W. Howells, who confused Weidenreich's hypothesis with a polygenic ""candelabra model"" in his publications spanning five decades: How did Multiregional evolution get stigmatized as polygeny? We believe it comes from the confusion of Weidenreich's id","According to the context, St. Hilaire believed there were at least four different archetypes, not Cuvier.

What is the current widely accepted view of phylogenies?,a phylogenetic bush,". The timeline reflects the mainstream views in modern taxonomy, based on the principle of phylogenetic nomenclature; in cases of open questions with no clear consensus, the main competing possibilities are briefly outlined. A tabular overview of the taxonomic ranking of Homo sapiens (with age estimates for each rank) is shown below. For another billion years, prokaryotes would continue to diversify undisturbed

. Hilaire's idea of homologous structures was more accepted. The second major argument is that of Aristotle's scala naturae (scale of nature) and the great chain of being versus the phylogenetic bush. The scala naturae, later also called the phylogenetic scale, was based on the premise that phylogenies are linear or like a scale while the phylogenetic bush argument was based on the idea that phylogenies were not linear, and more resembled a bush – the currently accepted view

"As body size increases, what happens to the brain-to-body ratio?",It reduces,". A third major argument dealt with the size of the brain and whether relative size or absolute size was more relevant in determining function. In the late 18th century, it was determined that brain to body ratio reduces as body size increases

. However more recently, there is more focus on absolute brain size as this scales with internal structures and functions, with the degree of structural complexity, and with the amount of white matter in the brain, all suggesting that absolute size is much better predictor of brain function. Finally, a fourth argument is that of natural selection (Darwinism) versus developmental constraints (concerted evolution)

What is being suggested as a more accurate predictor of brain function?,Absolute brain size,". However more recently, there is more focus on absolute brain size as this scales with internal structures and functions, with the degree of structural complexity, and with the amount of white matter in the brain, all suggesting that absolute size is much better predictor of brain function. Finally, a fourth argument is that of natural selection (Darwinism) versus developmental constraints (concerted evolution)

. In contrast, some academics argue that it is unnecessary to posit the existence of highly domain specific modules, and, suggest that the neural anatomy of the brain supports a model based on more domain general faculties and processes. Moreover, empirical support for the domain-specific theory stems almost entirely from performance on variations of the Wason selection task which is extremely limited in scope as it only tests one subtype of deductive reasoning

. The increase in volume of the neocortex also included a rapid increase in size of the cerebellum.

What is accepted as the cause of adult species showing differences?,The evolution of development,". It is now accepted that the evolution of development is what causes adult species to show differences and evolutionary neuroscientists maintain that many aspects of brain function and structure are conserved across species. Throughout history, we see how evolutionary neuroscience has been dependent on developments in biological theory and techniques

. However, variations in manifest behavior can result from universal mechanisms interacting with different local environments. For example, Caucasians who move from a northern climate to the equator will have darker skin. The mechanisms regulating their pigmentation do not change; rather the input to those mechanisms change, resulting in different outputs

While there are many different modifications applied to individual tests to overcome the associated problems, two types of confounding variables are particularly important in hindering the accurate detection of adaptive evolution: demographic changes and biased gene conversion

What technique was developed by C. Golgi in 1873 that allowed for the description of the brain at the cellular level?,The silver nitrate method,". The field of evolutionary neuroscience has been shaped by the development of new techniques that allow for the discovery and examination of parts of the nervous system. In 1873, C. Golgi devised the silver nitrate method which allowed for the description of the brain at the cellular level as opposed to simply the gross level. Santiago and Pedro Ramon used this method to analyze numerous parts of brains, broadening the field of comparative neuroanatomy

. In the second half of the 19th century, new techniques allowed scientists to identify neuronal cell groups and fiber bundles in brains. In 1885, Vittorio Marchi discovered a staining technique that let scientists see induced axonal degeneration in myelinated axons, in 1950, the ""original nauta procedure"" allowed for more accurate identification of degenerating fibers, and in the 1970s, there were several discoveries of multiple molecular tracers which would be used for experiments even today

"What is estimated age of the earliest brainless creatures, according to the context?",550 million years ago,". In the last 20 years, cladistics has also become a useful tool for looking at variation in the brain. Many of Earth's early years were filled with brainless creatures, and among them was the amphioxus, which can be traced as far back as 550 million years ago. Amphioxi had a significantly simpler way of life, which made it not necessary for them to have a brain. To replace its absence of a brain, the prehistoric amphioxi had a limited nervous system, which was composed of only a bunch of cells

What was one purpose of the cells in this organism?,propelling itself through bodies of water,". These cells optimized their uses because many of the cells for sensing intertwined with the cells used for its very simple system for moving, which allowed it to propel itself through bodies of water and react without much processing while the cells remaining were used for the detection of light to account to the fact that it had no eyes. It also did not need a sense of hearing

They progressively started to develop cardiovascular systems, respiratory systems and immune systems to survive in their environments, which required bodies to have something more complex than the limited quality of cells to regulate themselves. This encouraged the nervous systems of many creatures to develop into a brain, which was sizeable and strikingly similar to how most animal brains look today

. If the theory that language could have evolved as a single adaptation is accepted, the question becomes which of its many functions has been the basis of adaptation. Several evolutionary hypotheses have been posited: that language evolved for the purpose of social grooming, that it evolved as a way to show mating potential or that it evolved to form social contracts

When did the Earth enter the Cambrian period?,500 million years ago,". Although many scientists once assumed that the brain evolved to achieve an ability to think, such a view is today considered a great misconception. 500 million years ago, the Earth entered into the Cambrian period, where hunting became a new concern for survival in an animal's environment. At this point, animals became sensitive to the presence of another, which could serve as food

. The basic idea is that evolving human mothers, unlike their counterparts in other primates, could not move around and forage with their infants clinging onto their backs. Loss of fur in the human case left infants with no means of clinging on. Frequently, therefore, mothers had to put their babies down. As a result, these babies needed to be reassured that they were not being abandoned

. Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world. Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects. Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects

What is the primary location in the brain where visual information is interpreted?,The occipital lobe,".(pp 75–76) Research about how visual perception has developed in evolution is today best understood through studying present-day primates since the organization of the brain cannot be ascertained only by analyzing fossilized skulls. The brain interprets visual information in the occipital lobe, a region in the back of the brain. The occipital lobe contains the visual cortex and the thalamus, which are the two main actors in processing visual information

What phenomenon can cause an on-edge soldier to believe a young child with a stick is a grown man with a gun?,The fight-or-flight mode being activated by the brain's sympathetic system,". For example, an on-edge soldier believes a young child with a stick is a grown man with a gun, as the brain's sympathetic system, or fight-or-flight mode, is activated. An example of this phenomenon can be observed in the rabbit-duck illusion. Depending on how the image is looked at, the brain can interpret the image of a rabbit, or a duck. There is no right or wrong answer, but it is proof that what is seen may not be the reality of the situation

What is the organization of the human auditory cortex divided into?,"core, belt, and parabelt",". The organization of the human auditory cortex is divided into core, belt, and parabelt. This closely resembles that of present-day primates. The concept of auditory perception resembles visual perception very similarly. Our brain is wired to act on what it expects to experience. The sense of hearing helps situate an individual, but it also gives them hints about what else is around them

. Only in humans (in the left hemisphere) is it also responsible for other processes associated with language use and acquisition, such as speech repetition and production, integration of phonemes with their lip movements, perception and production of intonations, phonological long-term memory (long-term memory storage of the sounds of words), and phonological working memory (the temporary storage of the sounds of words). Some evidence also indicates a role in recognizing others by their voices

What is a key difference between the cognitive lives of human primate relatives and those of vocal learning birds?,Nonhuman primates seem to lack imitative abilities,". Evidence of a rich cognitive life in primate relatives of humans is extensive, and a wide range of specific behaviours in line with Darwinian theory is well documented. However, until recently, research has disregarded nonhuman primates in the context of evolutionary linguistics, primarily because unlike vocal learning birds, our closest relatives seem to lack imitative abilities

. While other species have social learning, and thus some level of culture, only humans, some birds and chimpanzees are known to have cumulative culture. Boyd and Richerson argue that the evolution of cumulative culture depends on observational learning and is uncommon in other species because it is ineffective when it is rare in a population. They propose that the environmental changes occurring in the Pleistocene may have provided the right environmental conditions

. Primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable, but they remain reliable for the same reason—because they are hard to fake. Primate social intelligence is ""Machiavellian""—self-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples.

Is auditory perception a recent development in the history of the human race?,No,". Evolutionary speaking, there is great evidence suggesting a genetic groundwork for the concept of languages has been in place for millions of years, as with many other capabilities and behaviours observed today. While evolutionary linguists agree on the fact that volitional control over vocalizing and expressing language is a quite recent leap in the history of the human race, that is not to say auditory perception is a recent development as well

. Some researchers, applying auditory bioengineering models to computerised tomography scans of Neanderthal skulls, have asserted that Neanderthals had auditory capacity very similar to that of anatomically modern humans. These researchers claim that this finding implies that ""Neanderthals evolved the auditory capacities to support a vocal communication system as efficient as modern human speech."" Anatomically modern humans begin to appear in the fossil record in Ethiopia some 200,000 years ago

. Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as we know it emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of Homo sapiens. A development as complex as the reconfiguration of the human","According to the context, auditory perception is not a recent development in the history of the human race.

What is one reason why primates may be poorly equipped to learn sounds?,Visual cues and motoric pathways developed millions of years earlier in their evolution,". Research has shown substantial evidence of well-defined neural pathways linking cortices to organize auditory perception in the brain. Thus, the issue lies in our abilities to imitate sounds. Beyond the fact that primates may be poorly equipped to learn sounds, studies have shown them to learn and use gestures far better. Visual cues and motoric pathways developed millions of years earlier in our evolution, which seems to be one reason for our earlier ability to understand and use gestures

What is the underlying mechanism by which an animal's brain develops specific cognitive functions?,Evolution,". Evolution shows how certain environments and surroundings will favor the development of specific cognitive functions of the brain to aid an animal or in this case human to successfully live in that environment. Cognitive specialization in a theory in which cognitive functions, such as the ability to communicate socially, can be passed down genetically through offspring. This would benefit species in the process of natural selection

. Its central assumption is that the human brain is composed of a large number of specialized mechanisms that were shaped by natural selection over a vast period of time to solve the recurrent information-processing problems faced by our ancestors. These problems involve food choices, social hierarchies, distributing resources to offspring, and selecting mates

What specific social skills apart from language have been theorized to be passed on by offspring?,"Trust, vulnerability, navigation, and self-awareness",". As for studying this in relation to the human brain, it has been theorized that very specific social skills apart from language, such as trust, vulnerability, navigation, and self-awareness can also be passed by offspring. --- # Evolutionary origin of religion The evolutionary origin of religion and religious behavior is a field of study related to evolutionary psychology, the origin of language and mythology, and cross-cultural comparison of the anthropology of religion

. Tomasello argues that studies of how children and primates actually acquire communicative skills suggest that humans learn complex behavior through experience, so that instead of a module specifically dedicated to language acquisition, language is acquired by the same cognitive mechanisms that are used to acquire all other kinds of socially transmitted behavior. On the issue of whether language is best seen as having evolved as an adaptation or as a spandrel, evolutionary biologist W

What is the estimated time period when humans shared a common ancestor with chimpanzees and bonobos?,six to eight million years ago,". Some subjects of interest include Neolithic religion, evidence for spirituality or cultic behavior in the Upper Paleolithic, and similarities in great ape behavior. Humanity's closest living relatives are common chimpanzees and bonobos. These primates share a common ancestor with humans who lived between six and eight million years ago. It is for this reason that chimpanzees and bonobos are viewed as the best available surrogate for this common ancestor

. The chimpanzee–human divergence likely took place around 10 to 7 million years ago. The list of fossils begins with Graecopithecus, dated some 7.2 million years ago, which may or may not still be ancestral to both the human and the chimpanzee lineage. For the earlier history of the human lineage, see Timeline of human evolution#Hominidae, Hominidae#Phylogeny

. According to the Chimpanzee Genome Project, the human–chimpanzee last common ancestor existed about five to six million years ago, assuming a constant rate of mutation. However, hominin species dated to earlier than the date could call this into question. Sahelanthropus tchadensis, commonly called ""Toumai"", is about seven million years old and Orrorin tugenensis lived at","Based on the context, the answer is:

Do non-human primates exhibit some traits that would have been necessary for the evolution of religion?,Yes,". Barbara King argues that while non-human primates are not religious, they do exhibit some traits that would have been necessary for the evolution of religion. These traits include high intelligence, a capacity for symbolic communication, a sense of social norms, and realization of ""self"" continuity. Elephants perform rituals for their dead. They demonstrate long periods of silence and mourning at the point of death; later, elephants return to grave sites and caress the remains

What was the peak time for the size of the hominid brain?,"500,000 years ago",". During human evolution, on at least two occasions, hominid brain size increased rapidly over a short period of time followed by a period of stasis. The first period of brain expansion occurred 2.5 million years ago, when Homo habilis first began using stone tools. The second period occurred 500,000 years ago, with the emergence of archaic Homo sapiens

. Fossilized skulls shows the brain size in early humans fell within the range of modern humans 300,000 years ago, but only got its present-day brain shape between 100,000 and 35,000 years ago. The temporal lobes, which contain centers for language processing, have increased disproportionately, as has the prefrontal cortex, which has been related to complex decision-making and moderating social behavior

. Increasing brain size has also been significant in human evolution. It began to increase approximately 2.4 million years ago, but modern levels of brain size were not attained until after 500,000 years ago. Zoological analyses have shown that the size of human brains is significantly larger than what anatomists would expect for their size. The human brain is three to four times larger than its closest relative, which is the chimp","According to the context, there are two periods mentioned where hominid brain size increased rapidly over a short period of time. The first one occurred 2.5 million years ago with the emergence of Homo habilis, and the second one occurred 500,000 years ago with the emergence of archaic Homo sapiens.

Since we are looking for the peak time for the size of the hominid brain, it is likely that modern levels of brain size were not attained until after 500,000 years ago. Therefore, the peak time for the size of the hominid brain was likely around 500,000 years ago with the emergence of archaic Homo sapiens.

However, if you're looking for the exact peak time in terms of fossilized skulls showing modern human brain shape, it would be between 100,000 and 35,000 years ago.",0.9,0.8,0.7,0.9,0.0,"The LLM correctly identified that the peak time for the size of the hominid brain was 500,000 years ago."
"What is believed to be responsible for neural computations underlying complex phenomena such as perception, thought, language, attention, episodic memory and voluntary movement?",The cerebral neocortex,". The cerebral neocortex is presumed to be responsible for the neural computations underlying complex phenomena such as perception, thought, language, attention, episodic memory and voluntary movement. According to Dunbar's theory, the relative neocortex size of any species correlates with the level of social complexity of the particular species. The neocortex size correlates with a number of social variables that include social group size and complexity of mating behaviors

. The brain allows an individual to recognize patterns, perceive speech, develop strategies to circumvent ecologically-based problems such as foraging for food, and also permits the phenomenon of color vision. It is said that in humans and primates the neocortex is responsible for reasoning and consciousness. Furthermore, having a large brain is a reflection of the large cognitive demands of complex social systems

When did the critical event in the evolution of the neocortex take place?,"About 500,000 years ago",". In chimpanzees the neocortex occupies 50% of the brain, whereas in modern humans it occupies 80% of the brain. Robin Dunbar argues that the critical event in the evolution of the neocortex took place at the speciation of archaic Homo sapiens about 500,000 years ago. His study indicates that only after the speciation event is the neocortex large enough to process complex social phenomena such as language and religion

. Studies of the brain began during ancient Egyptian times but studies in the field of evolutionary neuroscience began after the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859. At that time, brain evolution was largely viewed at the time in relation to the incorrect scala naturae. Phylogeny and the evolution of the brain were still viewed as linear. During the early 20th century, there were several prevailing theories about evolution

. Then, the second phase was a rapid Chomskian single step, consisting of three distinct events that happened in quick succession around 70,000 years ago and allowed the shift from non-recursive to recursive language in early hominins.

What is the basis for the study mentioned in the context?,A regression analysis of neocortex size plotted against a number of social behaviors of living and extinct hominids,"."" Context biases result from individuals using clues about the social structure of their population to determine what cultural variants to adopt. This determination is made without reference to the content of the variant. There are two major categories of context biases: model-based biases, and frequency-dependent biases. Model-based biases result when an individual is biased to choose a particular ""cultural model"" to imitate

. Scholars wishing to study the origins of language draw inferences from evidence such as the fossil record, archaeological evidence, and contemporary language diversity. They may also study language acquisition as well as comparisons between human language and systems of animal communication (particularly other primates)

What is a key factor in the evolution of belief according to Lewis Wolpert?,Causal beliefs,". Lewis Wolpert argues that causal beliefs that emerged from tool use played a major role in the evolution of belief. The manufacture of complex tools requires creating a mental image of an object that does not exist naturally before actually making the artifact. Furthermore, one must understand how the tool would be used, that requires an understanding of causality. Accordingly, the level of sophistication of stone tools is a useful indicator of causal beliefs

. The two main schools of thought hold: Stephen Jay Gould, for example, saw religion as an exaptation or a spandrel, in other words: religion evolved as byproduct of psychological mechanisms that evolved for other reasons

. The need for social intelligence surrounding theory of mind is a possible answer to the question as to why morality has evolved as a part of human behavior. Psychologist Matt J. Rossano muses that religion emerged after morality and built upon morality by expanding the social scrutiny of individual behavior to include supernatural third-party agents

Can chimpanzees figure out how to escape from pens closed with multiple latches?,Yes,". Wolpert contends use of tools composed of more than one component, such as hand axes, represents an ability to understand cause and effect. However, recent studies of other primates indicate that causality may not be a uniquely human trait. For example, chimpanzees have been known to escape from pens closed with multiple latches, which was previously thought could only have been figured out by humans who understood causality

. In captivity, nonhuman apes have been taught rudimentary forms of sign language or have been persuaded to use lexigrams—symbols that do not graphically resemble the corresponding words—on computer keyboards. Some nonhuman apes, such as Kanzi, have been able to learn and use hundreds of lexigrams.

What is the factor that determines the depth of comprehension in an animal?,The size of the prefrontal cortex,". Ultimately, there is some consensus within the field that a theory of mind is necessary for language use. Thus, the development of a full theory of mind in humans was a necessary precursor to full language use. In one particular study, rats and pigeons were required to press a button a certain number of times to get food. The animals showed very accurate distinction for numbers less than four, but as the numbers increased, the error rate increased

. Given the highly indeterminate way that mammalian brains develop—they basically construct themselves ""bottom up"", with one set of neuronal interactions preparing for the next round of interactions—degraded pathways would tend to seek out and find new opportunities for synaptic hookups.

Does individual religious belief require prior development of language?,No,".[unreliable source?] Religion requires a system of symbolic communication, such as language, to be transmitted from one individual to another. Philip Lieberman states ""human religious thought and moral sense clearly rest on a cognitive-linguistic base"". From this premise science writer Nicholas Wade states: Another view distinguishes individual religious belief from collective religious belief. While the former does not require prior development of language, the latter does

. The individual human brain has to explain a phenomenon in order to comprehend and relate to it. This activity predates by far the emergence of language and may have caused it. The theory is, belief in the supernatural emerges from hypotheses arbitrarily assumed by individuals to explain natural phenomena that cannot be explained otherwise. The resulting need to share individual hypotheses with others leads eventually to collective religious belief

What is believed to be a primary driver of the emergence of language?,The need for humans to explain and comprehend natural phenomena,". But Pinker and Bloom argue that the organic nature of language strongly suggests that it has an adaptational origin. Evolutionary psychologists hold that the FOXP2 gene may well be associated with the evolution of human language. In the 1980s, psycholinguist Myrna Gopnik identified a dominant gene that causes language impairment in the KE family of Britain. This gene turned out to be a mutation of the FOXP2 gene

Attempts to explain the origin of language take a variety of forms: Most linguistic scholars as of 2024[update] favor continuity-based theories, but they vary in how they hypothesize language development.

What is thought to have evolved before or concurrently with language?,A very specific social structure,". This is to highlight that even though grammar may have been unavailable, use of foresight, planning and symbolic thought can be evidence of language as early as one million years ago with Homo erectus.

One controversial suggestion is that certain pre-adaptations for spoken language evolved during a time when ancestral hominins lived close to river banks and lake shores rich in fatty acids and other brain-specific nutrients.

The attribution of spiritual essence to everything surrounding early humans served as a built-in mechanism that provided instant verification and ensured the inviolability of one's speech. Animal vocal signals are, for the most part, intrinsically reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal's contented state.

Do some social animals exhibit pre-moral sentiments?,True,". Although morality awareness may be a unique human trait, many social animals, such as primates, dolphins and whales, have been known to exhibit pre-moral sentiments

. De Waal contends that all social animals have had to restrain or alter their behavior for group living to be worthwhile. Pre-moral sentiments evolved in primate societies as a method of restraining individual selfishness and building more cooperative groups. For any social species, the benefits of being part of an altruistic group should outweigh the benefits of individualism. For example, a lack of group cohesion could make individuals more vulnerable to attack from outsiders

According to Michael Shermer, the following characteristics are shared by humans and other social animals, particularly the great apes: attachment and bonding, cooperation and mutual aid, sympathy and empathy, direct and indirect reciprocity, altruism and reciprocal altruism, conflict resolution and peacemaking, deception and deception detection, community concern and caring about what others think about you, and awareness of and response to the social rules of the group

. Highly social mammals such as primates and elephants have been known to exhibit traits that were once thought to be uniquely human, like empathy and altruism. Humanity's closest living relatives are common chimpanzees and bonobos. These primates share a common ancestor with humans who lived four to six million years ago. It is for this reason that chimpanzees and bonobos are viewed as the best available surrogate for this common ancestor

What is the primary motivation for social animals to restrain or alter their behavior?,To build more cooperative groups and reduce individual selfishness,". De Waal contends that all social animals have had to restrain or alter their behavior for group living to be worthwhile. Pre-moral sentiments evolved in primate societies as a method of restraining individual selfishness and building more cooperative groups. For any social species, the benefits of being part of an altruistic group should outweigh the benefits of individualism. For example, a lack of group cohesion could make individuals more vulnerable to attack from outsiders

. Being part of a group may also improve the chances of finding food. This is evident among animals that hunt in packs to take down large or dangerous prey. All social animals have hierarchical societies in which each member knows its own place. Social order is maintained by certain rules of expected behavior and dominant group members enforce order through punishment. Additionally, higher order primates also have a sense of fairness

Chimpanzees remember who did them favors and who did them wrong. For example, chimpanzees are more likely to share food with individuals who have previously groomed them. Vampire bats also demonstrate a sense of reciprocity and altruism. They share blood by regurgitation, but do not share randomly

What is the average number of individuals in a chimpanzee group?,50,". Chimpanzees live in fission-fusion groups that average 50 individuals. It is likely that early ancestors of humans lived in groups of similar size. Based on the size of extant hunter-gatherer societies, recent Paleolithic hominids lived in bands of a few hundred individuals. As community size increased over the course of human evolution, greater enforcement to achieve group cohesion would have been required

. They are most likely to share with other bats who have shared with them in the past or who are in dire need of feeding. Animals such as Capuchin monkeys and dogs also display an understanding of fairness, refusing to co-operate when presented unequal rewards for the same behaviors. Chimpanzees live in fission-fusion groups that average 50 individuals. It is likely that early ancestors of humans lived in groups of similar size

. However, a 2012 study in Iceland of 78 children and their parents suggests a mutation rate of only 36 mutations per generation; this datum extends the separation between humans and chimpanzees to an earlier period greater than 7 million years ago (Ma). Additional research with 226 offspring of wild chimpanzee populations in eight locations suggests ","According to the context, the average number of individuals in a chimpanzee group is 50.",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.9,1.0,"The answer seems to be correct, but it could be improved by providing more context about the specific species and historical context."
"According to Dr. de Waal, what is unique about human morality compared to primate societies?",Human morality has two extra levels of sophistication that are not found in primate societies.,". Barbara King argues that while primates may not possess morality in the human sense, they do exhibit some traits that would have been necessary for the evolution of morality. These traits include high intelligence, a capacity for symbolic communication, a sense of social norms, realization of ""self"", and a concept of continuity. Frans de Waal and Barbara King both view human morality as having grown out of primate sociality

. This numerical limit is theorized to be hard coded in our genes since even modern humans have difficulty maintaining stable social relationships with more than 100–200 people.

"According to Rossano's theory, what is the initial nature of individual religious belief?",epistemological,". By including ever-watchful ancestors, spirits and gods in the social realm, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups. The adaptive value of religion would have enhanced group survival. Rossano is referring here to collective religious belief and the social sanction that institutionalized morality. According to Rossano's teaching, individual religious belief is thus initially epistemological, not ethical, in nature

. The need for social intelligence surrounding theory of mind is a possible answer to the question as to why morality has evolved as a part of human behavior. Psychologist Matt J.

Cognitive scientists underlined that religions may be explained as a result of the brain architecture that developed early in the genus Homo in the course of the evolutionary history of life. Nonetheless, there is disagreement on the exact mechanisms that drove the evolution of the religious mind

What is one example of a mechanism humans may use to infer the presence of organisms that might do harm?,Agent detection,".[unreliable source?] Such mechanisms may include the ability to infer the presence of organisms that might do harm (agent detection), the ability to come up with causal narratives for natural events (etiology), and the ability to recognize that other people have minds of their own with their own beliefs, desires and intentions (theory of mind)

One example is things that increase the risk of an infectious disease such as spoiled foods, dead bodies, other forms of microbiological decomposition, a physical appearance suggesting sickness or poor hygiene, and various body fluids such as feces, vomit, phlegm, and blood. Another example is disgust against evolutionary disadvantageous mating such as incest (the incest taboo) or unwanted sexual advances

What is the concept proposed by Paul D. MacLean that categorizes the brain into three parts?,"The triune brain: the reptilian brain, the limbic system, and the neocortex",". In the classical era Plato first described this concept as the ""lizard mind"" – the deepest layer and one of three parts of his conception of a three-part human mind. In the 20th century P. MacLean developed a similar, modern triune brain theory.(pp 14–16) Recent research in molecular genetics has demonstrated evidence that there is no difference in the neurons that reptiles and nonhuman mammals have when compared to humans

. One controversial proposal, the God gene hypothesis, states that some variants of a specific gene, the VMAT2 gene, predispose to spirituality. Another view builds on the concept of the triune brain: the reptilian brain, the limbic system, and the neocortex, proposed by Paul D. MacLean. Collective religious belief draws upon the emotions of love, fear, and gregariousness and is deeply embedded in the limbic system through socio-biological conditioning and social sanction

It fails to capture the nuances and complexities of the triune brain theory."
What is generally considered stronger between the neocortex and the limbic system?,The limbic system,". Individual religious belief utilizes reason based in the neocortex and often varies from collective religion. The limbic system is much older in evolutionary terms than the neocortex and is, therefore, stronger than it – much in the same way as the reptilian is stronger than both the limbic system and the neocortex

. The cerebral neocortex is presumed to be responsible for the neural computations underlying complex phenomena such as perception, thought, language, attention, episodic memory and voluntary movement. According to Dunbar's theory, the relative neocortex size of any species correlates with the level of social complexity of the particular species. The neocortex size correlates with a number of social variables that include social group size and complexity of mating behaviors

. In chimpanzees the neocortex occupies 50% of the brain, whereas in modern humans it occupies 80% of the brain. Robin Dunbar argues that the critical event in the evolution of the neocortex took place at the speciation of archaic Homo sapiens about 500,000 years ago. His study indicates that only after the speciation event is the neocortex large enough to process complex social phenomena such as ","According to the context, the limbic system is generally considered stronger than the neocortex because it is much older in evolutionary terms.

What may help people who participate in a religion feel better?,Calming the mind,". Yet another view is that the behavior of people who participate in a religion makes them feel better and this improves their biological fitness, so that there is a genetic selection in favor of people who are willing to believe in a religion. Specifically, rituals, beliefs, and the social contact typical of religious groups may serve to calm the mind (for example by reducing ambiguity and the uncertainty due to complexity) and allow it to function better when under stress

This would allow religion to be used as a powerful survival mechanism, particularly in facilitating the evolution of hierarchies of warriors, which if true, may be why many modern religions tend to promote fertility and kinship.

While the earliest extant shamanic cave-paintings date to around 40 kya, the use of ocher for rock art predates this and there is clear evidence for abstract thinking along the coast of South Africa 80 kya. Paul Bloom suggests that ""certain early emergent cognitive biases ... make it natural to believe in Gods and spirits""

. Wentzel van Huyssteen states that the translation of the non-visible through symbolism enabled early human ancestors to hold beliefs in abstract terms. Some of the earliest evidence of symbolic behavior is associated with Middle Stone Age sites in Africa. From at least 100,000 years ago, there is evidence of the use of pigments such as red ocher. Pigments are of little practical use to hunter gatherers, thus evidence of their use is interpreted as symbolic or for ritual purposes

This is far outside of any otherwise known habitat, during a high ice cover period, and perhaps reflects a refugia of near extinction. Homo sapiens are believed to have emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago, based in part on thermoluminescence dating of artifacts and remains from Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, published in 2017

A variety of grave goods were found at the burial site. The mandible of a wild boar was found placed in the arms of one of the skeletons

. A joint Franco-Indian team has found human artifacts in the Siwalk Hills north of New Delhi dating back at least 2.6 million years. This is earlier than the previous earliest finding of genus Homo at Dmanisi, in Georgia, dating to 1.85 million years. Although controversial, tools found at a Chinese cave strengthen the case that humans used tools as far back as 2.48 million years ago

. They entered Eurasia by the Zagros Mountains (near present-day Iran and eastern Turkey) around 50,000 years ago, with one group rapidly settling coastal areas around the Indian Ocean and another migrating north to the steppes of Central Asia.

When did anatomically modern hominids who emigrated from Africa to the Middle East invent burial rituals incorporating grave goods?,"Roughly 100,000 years ago",". Philip Lieberman states: Burial rituals incorporating grave goods may have been invented by the anatomically modern hominids who emigrated from Africa to the Middle East roughly 100,000 years ago Matt Rossano suggests that the period between 80,000 and 60,000 years before present, following the retreat of humans from the Levant to Africa, was a crucial period in the evolution of religion. The use of symbolism in religion is a universal established phenomenon

. Neanderthals are also contenders for the first hominids to intentionally bury the dead. They may have placed corpses into shallow graves along with stone tools and animal bones. The presence of these grave goods may indicate an emotional connection with the deceased and possibly a belief in the afterlife. Neanderthal burial sites include Shanidar in Iraq and Krapina in Croatia and Kebara Cave in Israel. The earliest known burial of modern humans is from a cave in Israel located at Qafzeh

What is a common approach used to communicate and share supernatural concepts among others?,anchoring these supernatural beings in material form through representational art,". Archeologist Steven Mithen contends that it is common for religious practices to involve the creation of images and symbols to represent supernatural beings and ideas. Because supernatural beings violate the principles of the natural world, there will always be difficulty in communicating and sharing supernatural concepts with others. This problem can be overcome by anchoring these supernatural beings in material form through representational art

. The individual human brain has to explain a phenomenon in order to comprehend and relate to it. This activity predates by far the emergence of language and may have caused it. The theory is, belief in the supernatural emerges from hypotheses arbitrarily assumed by individuals to explain natural phenomena that cannot be explained otherwise. The resulting need to share individual hypotheses with others leads eventually to collective religious belief

When translated into material form, supernatural concepts become easier to communicate and understand.[unreliable source?] Due to the association of art and religion, evidence of symbolism in the fossil record is indicative of a mind capable of religious thoughts. Art and symbolism demonstrates a capacity for abstract thought and imagination necessary to construct religious ideas

. Wentzel van Huyssteen states that the translation of the non-visible through symbolism enabled early human ancestors to hold beliefs in abstract terms. Some of the earliest evidence of symbolic behavior is associated with Middle Stone Age sites in Africa. From at least 100,000 years ago, there is evidence of the use of pigments such as red ocher. Pigments are of little practical use to hunter gatherers, thus evidence of their use is interpreted as symbolic or for ritual purposes

Another approach, this time archaeological, involves invoking symbolic behavior (such as repeated ritual activity) that may leave an archaeological trace—such as mining and modifying ochre pigments for body-painting—while developing theoretical arguments to justify inferences from symbolism in general to language in particu","According to the context, the presence of symbolism in the fossil record indicates a mind capable of religious thoughts and a capacity for abstract thought and imagination necessary to construct religious ideas.",0.8,0.6,0.7,0.5,0.9,The answer provides a relevant definition of the term 'symbolism' but lacks depth and fails to explain how this concept relates to the presence of symbolism in the fossil record.

It has been argued that it is universal among human cultures for the color red to represent blood, sex, life and death. The use of red ocher as a proxy for symbolism is often criticized as being too indirect. Some scientists, such as Richard Klein and Steven Mithen, only recognize unambiguous forms of art as representative of abstract ideas

. Manning asserts that skin color is more correlated with the occurrence of polygyny – because melanin has an antimicrobial function – than the latitudinal gradient in intensity of ultraviolet radiation. Research seems to contradict Manning's explanation about skin color.

What was the primary impact of the Neolithic Revolution on human societies?,A population explosion,". The invention of agriculture transformed many human societies from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a sedentary lifestyle. The Neolithic Revolution led to a population explosion and an acceleration in the pace of technological development. The transition from foraging bands to states and empires precipitated more specialized and developed forms of religion that reflected the new social and political environment

. This suggests that political authority co-opts collective religious belief to bolster itself. Following the Neolithic Revolution, the pace of technological development (cultural evolution) intensified due to the invention of writing 5,000 years ago. Symbols that became words later on made effective communication of ideas possible.

What is the primary focus of adaptationist thinking in evolutionary psychology?,Human psychological adaptations with regard to the ancestral problems they evolved to solve,". Evolutionary psychologists respond that they are working within a nature-nurture interactionist framework that acknowledges that many psychological adaptations are facultative (sensitive to environmental variations during individual development). The discipline is generally not focused on proximate analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations)

. Evolutionary psychology focuses primarily on the ""why?"" questions, while traditional psychology focuses on the ""how?"" questions. Evolutionary psychology is founded on several core premises. Evolutionary psychology has its historical roots in Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. In The Origin of Species, Darwin predicted that psychology would develop an evolutionary basis: In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches

What do evolutionary psychologists argue about the structure of the human mind?,"That it has modularity, with different psychological mechanisms evolving to solve different adaptive problems",". Evolutionary psychologists, for example, believe that the human brain is made up of innate modules, each of which is specialised only for very specific tasks, e. g. an anxiety module. According to evolutionary psychologists, these modules are given before the organism actually develops and are then activated by some environmental event

. While philosophers have generally considered the human mind to include broad faculties, such as reason and lust, evolutionary psychologists describe evolved psychological mechanisms as narrowly focused to deal with specific issues, such as catching cheaters or choosing mates. The discipline sees the human brain as having evolved specialized functions, called cognitive modules, or psychological adaptations which are shaped by natural selection

. By contrast, DIT models human culture at the individual level and views culture as the result of a dynamic evolutionary process at the population level.

What is the central assumption of the theory being described?,The human brain is composed of a large number of specialized mechanisms that were shaped by natural selection over a vast period of time,". The individual human brain has to explain a phenomenon in order to comprehend and relate to it. This activity predates by far the emergence of language and may have caused it. The theory is, belief in the supernatural emerges from hypotheses arbitrarily assumed by individuals to explain natural phenomena that cannot be explained otherwise. The resulting need to share individual hypotheses with others leads eventually to collective religious belief

. Coalitional psychology offers falsifiable ex ante prediction by positing five hypotheses on how these psychological adaptations operate: Critics of evolutionary psychology accuse it of promoting genetic determinism, pan-adaptationism (the idea that all behaviors and anatomical features are adaptations), unfalsifiable hypotheses, distal or ultimate explanations of behavior when proximate explanations are superior, and malevolent political or moral ideas

What is the primary domain specified by Evolutionary Psychology for mental processes?,the problems of survival and reproduction,". It describes mental processes as computational operations, so that, for example, a fear response is described as arising from a neurological computation that inputs the perceptional data, e.g. a visual image of a spider, and outputs the appropriate reaction, e.g. fear of possibly dangerous animals. Under this view, any domain-general learning is impossible because of the combinatorial explosion. Evolutionary Psychology specifies the domain as the problems of survival and reproduction

. Though evolutionary psychology has traditionally focused on individual-level behaviors, determined by species-typical psychological adaptations, considerable work has been done on how these adaptations shape and, ultimately govern, culture (Tooby and Cosmides, 1989). Tooby and Cosmides (1989) argued that the mind consists of many domain-specific psychological adaptations, some of which may constrain what cultural material is learned or taught

"According to evolutionary psychologists, what is the primary function of cognitive modules in the human brain?",specialized functions that deal with specific issues,". Evolutionary psychologists, for example, believe that the human brain is made up of innate modules, each of which is specialised only for very specific tasks, e. g. an anxiety module. According to evolutionary psychologists, these modules are given before the organism actually develops and are then activated by some environmental event

. While philosophers have generally considered the human mind to include broad faculties, such as reason and lust, evolutionary psychologists describe evolved psychological mechanisms as narrowly focused to deal with specific issues, such as catching cheaters or choosing mates. The discipline sees the human brain as having evolved specialized functions, called cognitive modules, or psychological adaptations which are shaped by natural selection

Examples include language-acquisition modules, incest-avoidance mechanisms, cheater-detection mechanisms, intelligence and sex-specific mating preferences, foraging mechanisms, alliance-tracking mechanisms, agent-detection mechanisms, and others. Some mechanisms, termed domain-specific, deal with recurrent adaptive problems over the course of human evolutionary history. Domain-general mechanisms, on the other hand, are proposed to deal with evolutionary novelty

. The role of sexual selection in human evolution has been considered controversial from the moment of publication of Darwin's book on sexual selection (1871)

. Darwin applied the theory of evolution and sexual selection to humans in his 1871 book The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. A major problem in the 19th century was the lack of fossil intermediaries

What is a primary focus of behavioral genetics?,Establishing some measure of the relative influence of genetics and environment on behavior,". The field of behavioral genetics is focused on the study of the proximate influence of genes on behavior. A frequent critique of the discipline is that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychology are frequently arbitrary and difficult or impossible to adequately test, thus questioning its status as an actual scientific discipline, for example because many current traits probably evolved to serve different functions than they do now

What is one way that natural selection is thought to have provided humans with psychological adaptations?,Many psychological adaptations,". Evolutionary psychologists say that natural selection has provided humans with many psychological adaptations, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations. As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Sexual selection provides organisms with adaptations related to mating

. It seeks to identify human psychological adaptations with regard to the ancestral problems they evolved to solve. In this framework, psychological traits and mechanisms are either functional products of natural and sexual selection or non-adaptive by-products of other adaptive traits. Adaptationist thinking about physiological mechanisms, such as the heart, lungs, and the liver, is common in evolutionary biology

.6 million years ago. Because the Pleistocene ended a mere 12,000 years ago, most human adaptations either newly evolved during the Pleistocene, or were maintained by stabilizing selection during the Pleistocene. Evolutionary psychology, therefore, proposes that the majority of human psychological mechanisms are adapted to re","According to the context, one way that natural selection is thought to have provided humans with psychological adaptations is by providing them with specialized solutions to the ancestral problems they evolved to solve in their environment of evolutionary adaptedness.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.8,0.9,The context is somewhat vague and could be interpreted in multiple ways. The LLM could have been more specific about how natural selection provides psychological adaptations.
What is the primary outcome of sexual selection for male mammals?,adaptations that help them compete for females,". For male mammals, which have a relatively high maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females. For female mammals, with a relatively low maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates. Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, and he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of altruistic (self-sacrificing) behavior

. Sexual selection is a biological way one sex chooses a mate for the best reproductive success. Most compete with others of the same sex for the best mate to contribute their genome for future generations. This has shaped human evolution for many years, but reasons why humans choose their mates are not fully understood. Sexual selection is quite different in non-human animals than humans as they feel more of the evolutionary pressures to reproduce and can easily reject a mate

. Consequently, human females may evolve preferences for these traits, which then comprise an additional selection pressure. However, secondary sexual characteristics in human males do not always enhance overall attracti","According to the context, the primary outcome of sexual selection for male mammals is that they develop adaptations that help them compete for females.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.5,0.9,"The LLM correctly states that sexual selection leads to adaptations that help male mammals compete for females, but it could provide more specific examples or discuss the role of other selective pressures like natural selection in shaping sexual characteristics."
In what year did evolutionary biologist William D. Hamilton propose inclusive fitness theory?,1964,". But group selection was considered a weak explanation, because in any group the less altruistic individuals will be more likely to survive, and the group will become less self-sacrificing as a whole. In 1964, the evolutionary biologist William D. Hamilton proposed inclusive fitness theory, emphasizing a gene-centered view of evolution

. However, in 1964 W. D. Hamilton proved mathematically that, because close relatives of an organism share some identical genes, a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by promoting the reproduction and survival of these related or otherwise similar individuals. Hamilton concluded that this leads natural selection to favor organisms that would behave in ways that maximize their inclusive fitness. It is also true that natural selection favors behavior that maximizes personal fitness

. They see step parental care as primarily ""mating effort"" towards the genetic parent. Inclusive fitness is the sum of an organism's classical fitness (how many of its own offspring it produces and supports) and the number of equivalents of its own offspring it can add to the population by supporting others. The first component is called classical fitness by H","According to the context, W. D. Hamilton proposed inclusive fitness theory in 1964.",1.0,0.5,0.8,0.2,1.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the year 1964 as the proposed year for the theory, but it provides no context or details about the theory itself."
What is the mechanism by which genes can increase their replication?,Influencing an organism's social traits to help the survival and reproduction of other copies of the same genes,". Hamilton noted that genes can increase the replication of copies of themselves into the next generation by influencing the organism's social traits in such a way that (statistically) results in helping the survival and reproduction of other copies of the same genes (most simply, identical copies in the organism's close relatives)

. If there is an ""altruism gene"" (or complex of genes) that influences an organism's behavior to be helpful and protective of relatives and their offspring, this behavior also increases the proportion of the altruism gene in the population, because relatives are likely to share genes with the altruist due to common descent. Altruists may also have some way to recognize altruistic behavior in unrelated individuals and be inclined to support them

. But the changes are not usually random. Evolved programs add and subtract information, reshaping the ideas in ways that make them more ""intuitive"", more memorable, and more attention-grabbing. In other words, ""memes"" (ideas) are not precisely like genes. Genes are normally copied faithfully as they are replicated, but ideas normally are not. It's not just that ideas mutate every once in a while, like genes do
","According to the context, the mechanism by which genes can increase their replication is by influencing an organism's social traits in such a way that results in helping the survival and reproduction of other copies of the same genes (most simply, identical copies in the organism's close relatives).",0.7,0.8,0.6,0.4,0.0,"The LLM's answer is somewhat relevant, but it misses the mark by focusing on social traits instead of the molecular mechanisms involved in gene replication."
What is the primary condition for self-sacrificing behaviors to evolve according to Hamilton's rule?,They typically help the organism's close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice.,". According to Hamilton's rule, self-sacrificing behaviors (and the genes influencing them) can evolve if they typically help the organism's close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice. Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how altruism can evolve. Other theories also help explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, including evolutionary game theory, tit-for-tat reciprocity, and generalized reciprocity

. Hamilton's rule describes mathematically whether or not a gene for altruistic behavior will spread in a population: The concept serves to explain how natural selection can perpetuate altruism

. However, in 1964 W. D. Hamilton proved mathematically that, because close relatives of an organism share some identical genes, a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by promoting the reproduction and survival of these related or otherwise similar individuals. Hamilton concluded that this leads natural selection to favor organisms that would behave in ways that maximize their inclusive fitness.

However, the context could be improved by providing a specific example or reference to Hamilton's rule."
What is the strategy followed by humans according to the r/K selection theory?,having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one,". These theories help to explain the development of altruistic behavior, and account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism). Several mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The r/K selection theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring, while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy

. Humans follow the second strategy. Parental investment theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness

. In evolutionary terms, the best strategy to use for the prisoner's dilemma is tit-for-tat, where an individual should cooperate as long others are cooperating, and not defect until another individual defects against them. At their core, complex social interactions are driven by the need to distinguish sincere cooperation and defection. Brune details that theory of mind has been traced back to primates, but it is not observed to the extent that it is in the modern human

Natura","According to the context, humans follow the second strategy, which means investing more in each offspring and having fewer of them.",1.0,0.8,0.7,0.6,0.9,"The LLM correctly states that humans follow the second strategy, which means investing more in each offspring and having fewer of them."
What is the name of the theory that explains how parents invest in their offspring?,Parental investment theory,". Humans follow the second strategy. Parental investment theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness

. Components of fitness (Beatty 1992) include the well-being of existing offspring, parents' future reproduction, and inclusive fitness through aid to kin (Hamilton, 1964). Parental investment theory is a branch of life history theory. The benefits of parental investment to the offspring are large and are associated with the effects on condition, growth, survival, and ultimately, on the reproductive success of the offspring

. According to the Trivers–Willard hypothesis, parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to life history theory, animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring

"According to the Trivers–Willard hypothesis, what type of parents tend to invest more in daughters?",Parents in poor conditions,". According to the Trivers–Willard hypothesis, parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to life history theory, animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring

. Trivers noted that anisogamy typically results in different levels of parental investment between the sexes, with females initially investing more. Trivers proposed that this difference in parental investment leads to the sexual selection of different reproductive strategies between the sexes and to sexual conflict. For example, he suggested that the sex that invests less in offspring will generally compete for access to the higher-investing sex to increase their inclusive fitness

. Trivers posited that differential parental investment led to the evolution of sexual dimorphisms in mate choice, intra- and inter- sexual reproductive competition, and courtship displays. In mammals, including humans, females make a much","According to the context, parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.7,0.9,"The answer is somewhat correct, but it does not fully capture the essence of the Trivers–Willard hypothesis.

What does evolutionary psychology propose about cognition?,Evolutionary psychology proposes that cognition has a functional structure with a genetic basis that has evolved by natural selection,". Cognition refers to internal representations of the world and internal information processing. From an evolutionary psychology perspective, cognition is not ""general purpose"". Cognition uses heuristics, or strategies, that generally increase the likelihood of solving problems that the ancestors of present-day humans routinely faced in their lives

. These evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behavior is the output of psychological adaptations that evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments. Some evolutionary psychologists argue that evolutionary theory can provide a foundational, metatheoretical framework that integrates the entire field of psychology in the same way evolutionary biology has for biology

What is the primary goal of evolutionary psychologists in studying psychological mechanisms?,to understand the survival and reproductive functions they might have served over the course of evolutionary history,". Evolutionary psychologists are also interested in identifying these proximate mechanisms (sometimes termed ""mental mechanisms"" or ""psychological adaptations"") and what type of information they take as input, how they process that information, and their outputs. Evolutionary developmental psychology, or ""evo-devo,"" focuses on how adaptations may be activated at certain developmental times (e.g., losing baby teeth, adolescence, etc

. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared amongst a species and should solve important problems of survival and reproduction. Evolutionary psychologists seek to understand psychological mechanisms by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might have served over the course of evolutionary history

. Evolutionary psychology is primarily interested in finding commonalities between people, or basic human psychological nature.

"According to the theory of natural selection, what is humans' relationship with others often characterized as?",in conflict,".[page needed] These might include abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, cooperate with others and follow leaders. Consistent with the theory of natural selection, evolutionary psychology sees humans as often in conflict with others, including mates and relatives. For instance, a mother may wish to wean her offspring from breastfeeding earlier than does her infant, which frees up the mother to invest in additional offspring

. Evolutionary psychology also recognizes the role of kin selection and reciprocity in evolving prosocial traits such as altruism. Like chimpanzees and bonobos, humans have subtle and flexible social instincts, allowing them to form extended families, lifelong friendships, and political alliances

. As Dawkins points out in The Selfish Gene (Chapter 6) and The Extended Phenotype, this must be distinguished from the green-beard effect. Although it is generally true that humans tend to be more altruistic toward their kin than toward non-kin, the relevant proximate mechanisms that mediate this cooperation have been debated (see kin recognition), with some arguing that kin status is determined primarily ","According to the context, humans' relationship with others is often characterized as being ""in conflict"" with others, including mates and relatives.",0.8,0.9,0.7,0.8,0.0,The LLM correctly identifies the context as suggesting humans' conflict with each other but lacks specific examples or analysis of this conflict.

What has been found by evolutionary psychologists regarding infanticide?,Modest findings,". In studies testing theoretical predictions, evolutionary psychologists have made modest findings on topics such as infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price and parental investment. Another example would be the evolved mechanism in depression. Clinical depression is maladaptive and should have evolutionary approaches so it can become adaptive

. Daly and Wilson (1996) noted: ""Evolutionary thinking led to the discovery of the most important risk factor for child homicide – the presence of a stepparent. Parental efforts and investments are valuable resources, and selection favors those parental psyches that allocate effort effectively to promote fitness

. Evolutionary psychology has been applied to explain criminal or otherwise immoral behavior as being adaptive or related to adaptive behaviors. Males are generally more aggressive than females, who are more selective of their partners because of the far greater effort they have to contribute to pregnancy and child-rearing. Males being more aggressive is hypothesized to stem from the more intense reproductive competition faced by them

Did ancestral humans read or write?,No,". For example, the ability of toddlers to learn a language with virtually no training is likely to be a psychological adaptation. On the other hand, ancestral humans did not read or write, thus today, learning to read and write requires extensive training, and presumably involves the repurposing of cognitive capacities that evolved in response to selection pressures unrelated to written language

. In pre-literate societies, religious ideas were based on an oral tradition, which was articulated by shamans and remained limited to the collective memories of the society's inhabitants. With the advent of writing, information that was not easy to remember could easily be stored in sacred texts that were maintained by a select group (clergy). Humans could store and process large amounts of information with writing that otherwise would have been forgotten

. Writing is thought to have been first invented in either Sumeria or Ancient Egypt, and was initially used for accounting. Soon after, writing was used to record myth.

What can cause changes in manifest behavior?,Variations in universal mechanisms interacting with different local environments,". However, variations in manifest behavior can result from universal mechanisms interacting with different local environments. For example, Caucasians who move from a northern climate to the equator will have darker skin. The mechanisms regulating their pigmentation do not change; rather the input to those mechanisms change, resulting in different outputs

. The high rates of communicative disorders and psychopathy in males might facilitate their higher rates of disengagement from normative expectations and their insensitivity to social disapproval, when they deliberately do not follow social norms. Some of these speculations have yet to be developed into fully testable hypotheses, and a great deal of research is required to confirm their validity

. Facial and vocal attractiveness have been observed to change with estradiol and progesterone in pattens consistent with fertility-related increases, although some data challenge this interpretation. In general, ovulatory cycle changes are more subtle than in non-human primates, perhaps representing leakage of information on fertility and hormonal status rather than signals functioning to convey this information

What are the three characteristics that can be used to identify an adaptation?,"probable complexity, species universality, and adaptive functionality",". The methods used to identify adaptive evolution are generally devised to test the null hypothesis of neutral evolution, which, if rejected, provides evidence of adaptive evolution. These tests can be broadly divided into two categories. Firstly, there are methods that use a comparative approach to search for evidence of function-altering mutations

. One of the tasks of evolutionary psychology is to identify which psychological traits are likely to be adaptations, byproducts or random variation. George C.

Are psychological adaptations generally obligate or facultative?,Obligate,". A question that may be asked about an adaptation is whether it is generally obligate (relatively robust in the face of typical environmental variation) or facultative (sensitive to typical environmental variation). The sweet taste of sugar and the pain of hitting one's knee against concrete are the result of fairly obligate psychological adaptations; typical environmental variability during development does not much affect their operation

. When a psychological adaptation is facultative, evolutionary psychologists concern themselves with how developmental and environmental inputs influence the expression of the adaptation. Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations. Cultural universals include behaviors related to language, cognition, social roles, gender roles, and technology

However, it misses several other important universals, such as emotions and kin recognition."
What is one explanation for basic gender differences?,Sexually dimorphic psychological adaptations that reflect the different reproductive strategies of males and females,". It has been found that both male and female personality traits differ on a large spectrum. Males had a higher rate of traits relating to dominance, tension, and directness. Females had higher rates organizational behavior and more emotional based characteristics. Evolutionary psychologists contrast their approach to what they term the ""standard social science model,"" according to which the mind is a general-purpose cognition device shaped almost entirely by culture

. Femininity in the female face and voice provide cues to female reproductive hormones and reproductive potential. Males tend to have lower pitched voices than females, likely due to male intrasexual competition, but some evidence suggests that high female voice pitch may also be favored by male mate choice and function in intrasexual competition among females

. Evolved psychological adaptations (such as the ability to learn a language) interact with cultural inputs to produce specific behaviors (e.g., the specific language learned).

What were the personality traits that males had a higher rate of in comparison to females?,"Dominance, tension, and directness",". It has been found that both male and female personality traits differ on a large spectrum. Males had a higher rate of traits relating to dominance, tension, and directness. Females had higher rates organizational behavior and more emotional based characteristics. Evolutionary psychologists contrast their approach to what they term the ""standard social science model,"" according to which the mind is a general-purpose cognition device shaped almost entirely by culture

. In females, superiority in verbal abilities, higher rule obedience, socialisation, empathy and agreeableness can be presented as a reflection of the systemic conservation function of the female sex. Male superiority is mostly noted in exploratory abilities - in risk- and sensation seeking, spacial orientation, physical strength and higher rates in physical aggression

. There is further evidence from the same study that in fertile stages of the menstrual cycle, women also had a preference for other masculine traits such as body size, facial shape, and dominant behavior, which are indicators of both fertility and health.

"What is the term used to describe the environment in which the brain evolved, according to evolutionary psychology?",Environment of evolutionary adaptedness,". Evolutionary psychology argues that to properly understand the functions of the brain, one must understand the properties of the environment in which the brain evolved. That environment is often referred to as the ""environment of evolutionary adaptedness"". The idea of an environment of evolutionary adaptedness was first explored as a part of attachment theory by John Bowlby. This is the environment to which a particular evolved mechanism is adapted

. More specifically, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness is defined as the set of historically recurring selection pressures that formed a given adaptation, as well as those aspects of the environment that were necessary for the proper development and functioning of the adaptation. Humans, the genus Homo, appeared between 1.5 and 2.5 million years ago, a time that roughly coincides with the start of the Pleistocene 2.6 million years ago

"When did humans, the genus Homo, appear?",Between 1.5 and 2.5 million years ago,". The discovery of Neanderthal brought the first addition. The genus Homo was given its taxonomic name to suggest that its member species can be classified as human. And, over the decades of the 20th century, fossil finds of pre-human and early human species from late Miocene and early Pliocene times produced a rich mix for debating classifications. There is continuing debate on delineating Homo from Australopithecus—or, indeed, delineating Homo from Pan

. Traditionally, the advent of Homo has been taken to coincide with the first use of stone tools (the Oldowan industry), and thus by definition with the beginning of the Lower Palaeolithic. But in 2010, evidence was presented that seems to attribute the use of stone tools to Australopithecus afarensis around 3.3 million years ago, close to a million years before the first appearance of Homo.

The species was adaptive and successful, and persisted for more than a million years ","Based on the context, it is unclear exactly when humans (genus Homo) appeared. However, it is mentioned that H. erectus appeared about 2 million years ago, but whether this was considered the beginning of the species or just one stage in its evolution is not specified. The text also notes that there is debate on delineating Homo from Australopithecus, and that the use of stone tools has traditionally been associated with the beginning of Homo, but evidence suggests that Australopithecus may have used stone tools as well. Therefore, it is difficult to pinpoint an exact time when humans appeared based on this context alone.",0.5,0.2,0.7,0.4,0.0,"The answer provides a range of timeframes, but the exact date of human appearance is not specified."
When did the Pleistocene epoch end?,"12,000 years ago",".6 million years ago. Because the Pleistocene ended a mere 12,000 years ago, most human adaptations either newly evolved during the Pleistocene, or were maintained by stabilizing selection during the Pleistocene. Evolutionary psychology, therefore, proposes that the majority of human psychological mechanisms are adapted to reproductive problems frequently encountered in Pleistocene environments

. The frequency of 370A is most highly elevated in North Asian and East Asian populations. The most recent Ice Age peaked in intensity between 19,000 and 25,000 years ago and ended about 12,000 years ago. As the glaciers that once covered Scandinavia all the way down to Northern France retreated, humans began returning to Northern Europe from the Southwest, modern-day Spain

. The Paleolithic is subdivided into the Lower Paleolithic (Early Stone Age), ending around 350,000–300,000 years ago, the Middle Paleolithic (Middle Stone Age), until 50,000–30,000 years ago, and the Upper Paleolithic, (Late Stone Age), 50,000–10,000 years ago.

What were the environments of the ancestors of modern humans like?,"They lived in smaller groups, had more cohesive cultures, and had more stable and rich contexts for identity and meaning.",". Evolutionary psychologists sometimes look to chimpanzees, bonobos, and other great apes for insight into human ancestral behavior. Since an organism's adaptations were suited to its ancestral environment, a new and different environment can create a mismatch. Because humans are mostly adapted to Pleistocene environments, psychological mechanisms sometimes exhibit ""mismatches"" to the modern environment

. Modern humans emerged from Africa approximately 70,000 years ago during a period of unstable climate, leading to a variety of new traits among the population. When modern humans spread into Europe, they outcompeted Neanderthals. Researchers hypothesize that this suggests early modern humans were more evolutionarily fit to live in various climates

. Some critics have argued that researchers know so little about the environment in which Homo sapiens evolved that explaining specific traits as an adaption to that environment becomes highly speculative. Evolutionary psychologists respond that they do know many things about this environment, including the facts that present day humans' ancestors were hunter-gatherers, that they generally lived in small tribes, etc

. Analysis of small groups in New Guinea imply that cultural group selection might be a good explanation for slowly changing aspects of social structure, but not for rapidly changing fads. The ability of cultural evolution to maintain intergroup diversity is what allows for the study of cultural phylogenetics

. Based on the size of extant hunter gatherer societies, recent paleolithic hominids lived in bands of a few hundred individuals. As community size increased over the course of human evolution, greater enforcement to achieve group cohesion would have been required. Morality may have evolved in these bands of 100 to 200 people as a means of social control, conflict resolution and group solidarity

The characteristics of the niche are largely the same as for social mammals, who evolved over 30 million years ago: soothing perinatal experience, several years of on-request breastfeeding, nearly constant affection or physical proximity, responsiveness to need (mitigating offspring distress), self-directed play, and for humans, multiple responsive caregivers. Initial studies show the importance of these components in early life for positive child outcomes

. Highly social mammals such as primates and elephants have been known to exhibit traits that were once thought to be uniquely human, like empathy and altruism. Humanity's closest living relatives are common chimpanzees and bonobos. These primates share a common ancestor with humans who lived four to six million years ago. It is for this reason that chimpanzees and bonobos are viewed as the best available surrogate for this common ancestor

How many people are murdered by guns in the US annually?,"over 20,000",". One example is the fact that although over 20,000 people are murdered by guns in the US annually, whereas spiders and snakes kill only a handful, people nonetheless learn to fear spiders and snakes about as easily as they do a pointed gun, and more easily than an unpointed gun, rabbits or flowers. A potential explanation is that spiders and snakes were a threat to human ancestors throughout the Pleistocene, whereas guns (and rabbits and flowers) were not

Who coined the term 'supernormal stimulus'?,Niko Tinbergen,". There is thus a mismatch between humans' evolved fear-learning psychology and the modern environment. This mismatch also shows up in the phenomena of the supernormal stimulus, a stimulus that elicits a response more strongly than the stimulus for which the response evolved. The term was coined by Niko Tinbergen to refer to non-human animal behavior, but psychologist Deirdre Barrett said that supernormal stimulation governs the behavior of humans as powerfully as that of other animals

. Critics of the speech/ritual co-evolution idea theory include Noam Chomsky, who terms it the ""non-existence"" hypothesis—a denial of the very existence of language as an object of study for natural science. Chomsky's own theory is that language emerged in an instant and in perfect form, prompting his critics in turn, to retort that only something that does not exist—a theoretical construct or convenient scientific fiction—could possibly emerge in such a miraculous way

What is the context discussing as exaggerated stimuli?,television,". This is accomplished by using the data the brain has at its access, which can be to use past experiences and memories to form a proper response.(pp 66–67)</ref> However, sometimes the brain fails to predict accurately which means that the mind perceives a false illustration. Such an incorrect image occurs when the brain uses an inadequate memory to respond to what it is facing, which means that the memory does not correlate with the real scenario

. For example, an on-edge soldier believes a young child with a stick is a grown man with a gun, as the brain's sympathetic system, or fight-or-flight mode, is activated. An example of this phenomenon can be observed in the rabbit-duck illusion. Depending on how the image is looked at, the brain can interpret the image of a rabbit, or a duck. There is no right or wrong answer, but it is proof that what is seen may not be the reality of the situation

. To focus on mental states is to accept fictions—inhabitants of the imagination—as potentially informative and interesting. An example is metaphor: a metaphor is, literally, a false statement. In Romeo and Juliet, Romeo declares ""Juliet is the sun!"". Juliet is a woman, not a ball of plasma","The context is not discussing exaggerated stimuli. It's actually talking about how the brain can misinterpret or misperceive reality due to inadequate memories or activation of the sympathetic system (fight-or-flight mode).

Hence the dissatisfaction and alienation that many employees experience

. He suggests that male coalitions may have been the result of group-on-group aggression, defense, and in-group political alliances. This explanation does not support the relationship between male coalitions and hunting. Hawkes proposes that hunters pursue large game and divide the kill across the group. Hunters compete to divvy up the kill to signal courage, power, generosity, prosocial intent, and dedication. By engaging in these activities, hunters receive reproductive benefits and respect

What is one characteristic of an adaptation that distinguishes it from a byproduct or random variation?,Evidence of species universality,". As noted earlier, adaptations are expected to show evidence of complexity, functionality, and species universality, while byproducts or random variation will not. In addition, adaptations are expected to be presented as proximate mechanisms that interact with the environment in either a generally obligate or facultative fashion (see above)

Williams suggested that an ""adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should only be used where it is really necessary."" As noted by Williams and others, adaptations can be identified by their improbable complexity, species universality, and adaptive functionality

. A question that may be asked about an adaptation is whether it is generally obligate (relatively robust in the face of typical environmental variation) or facultative (sensitive to typical environmental variation). The sweet taste of sugar and the pain of hitting one's knee against concrete are the result of fairly obligate psychological adaptations; typical environmental variability during development does not much ","According to the context, one characteristic of an adaptation that distinguishes it from a byproduct or random variation is that it shows evidence of complexity.",0.8,0.6,0.7,0.5,0.9,"The LLM's answer is correct, but it provides a somewhat generic definition of an adaptation that doesn't capture the essence of what adaptations truly are. It also fails to mention the importance of species universality."
"What is the primary focus of evolutionary developmental psychology, or 'evo-devo'?",How adaptations may be activated at certain developmental times,". Evolutionary psychologists respond that they are working within a nature-nurture interactionist framework that acknowledges that many psychological adaptations are facultative (sensitive to environmental variations during individual development). The discipline is generally not focused on proximate analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations)

What is one strategy evolutionary psychologists use to develop and test hypotheses about whether a psychological trait is likely to be an evolved adaptation?,Cross-cultural Consistency,".g., losing baby teeth, adolescence, etc.) or how events during the development of an individual may alter life-history trajectories. Evolutionary psychologists use several strategies to develop and test hypotheses about whether a psychological trait is likely to be an evolved adaptation. Buss (2011) notes that these methods include: Cross-cultural Consistency

Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations, including the abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, and cooperate with others.

Findings have been made regarding human social behaviour related to infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price, and parental investment

. Evolutionary psychologists say that natural selection has provided humans with many psychological adaptations, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations. As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Sexual selection provides organisms with adaptations related to mating

Form to Function (reverse-engineering – or ""solution to problem"")

. However, under some circumstances, engaging in multiple sexual relationships can provide benefits to women as well, such as fertility insurance, trading up to better genes, reducing the risk of inbreeding, and insurance protection of her offspring. Due to male paternity uncertainty, sex differences have been found in the domains of sexual jealousy. Females generally react more adversely to emotional infidelity and males will react more to sexual infidelity

. This particular pattern is predicted because the costs involved in mating for each sex are distinct. Women, on average, should prefer a mate who can offer resources (e.g., financial, commitment), thus, a woman risks losing such resources with a mate who commits emotional infidelity.

In addition to evolutionary models that suggest evolution occurs across large spans of time, recent research has demonstrated that some evolutionary shifts can be fast and dramatic. Consequently, some evolutionary psychologists have focused on the impact of psychological traits in the current environment. Such research can be used to inform estimates of the prevalence of traits over time. Such work has been informative in studying evolutionary psychopathology

. Hawks et al. (2007) argue that demographic changes (particularly population expansion) may greatly facilitate adaptive evolution, an argument that somewhat corroborates the positive correlation inferred between population size and amount of adaptive evolution occurring mentioned previously. It has been suggested that cultural evolution may have replaced genetic evolution, and hence slowed the rate of adaptive evolution over the past 10,000 years

What types of sources of data are used by evolutionary psychologists?,"experiments, archaeological records, data from hunter-gatherer societies, observational studies, neuroscience data, self-reports and surveys, public records, and human products",". Evolutionary psychologists also use various sources of data for testing, including experiments, archaeological records, data from hunter-gatherer societies, observational studies, neuroscience data, self-reports and surveys, public records, and human products. Recently, additional methods and tools have been introduced based on fictional scenarios, mathematical models, and multi-agent computer simulations

. Evolutionary psychology has roots in cognitive psychology and evolutionary biology but also draws on behavioral ecology, artificial intelligence, genetics, ethology, anthropology, archaeology, biology, ecopsycology and zoology

. Evolutionary psychologists are also interested in identifying these proximate mechanisms (sometimes termed ""mental mechanisms"" or ""psychological adaptations"") and what type of information they take as input, how they process that information, and their outputs. Evolutionary developmental psychology, or ""evo-devo,"" focuses on how adaptations may be activated at certain developmental times (e.g., losing baby teeth, adolescence, etc

What are the broad categories of adaptive problems in evolutionary psychology?,"Survival, mating, parenting, family and kinship, interactions with non-kin, and cultural evolution",". Foundational areas of research in evolutionary psychology can be divided into broad categories of adaptive problems that arise from evolutionary theory itself: survival, mating, parenting, family and kinship, interactions with non-kin, and cultural evolution. Problems of survival are clear targets for the evolution of physical and psychological adaptations

. When a psychological adaptation is facultative, evolutionary psychologists concern themselves with how developmental and environmental inputs influence the expression of the adaptation. Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations. Cultural universals include behaviors related to language, cognition, social roles, gender roles, and technology

. These evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behavior is the output of psychological adaptations that evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments. Some evolutionary psychologists argue that evolutionary theory can provide a foundational, metatheoretical framework that integrates the entire field of psychology in the same way evolutionary biology has","According to the context, the broad categories of adaptive problems in evolutionary psychology are:

What are the three major problems faced by the ancestors of present-day humans?,Food selection and acquisition; territory selection and physical shelter; and avoiding predators and other environmental threats.,". Major problems the ancestors of present-day humans faced included food selection and acquisition; territory selection and physical shelter; and avoiding predators and other environmental threats. Consciousness meets George Williams' criteria of species universality, complexity, and functionality, and it is a trait that apparently increases fitness

. In broad terms, these problems include those of growth, development, differentiation, maintenance, mating, parenting, and social relationships. The environment of evolutionary adaptedness is significantly different from modern society. The ancestors of modern humans lived in smaller groups, had more cohesive cultures, and had more stable and rich contexts for identity and meaning

. For example, present-day humans are far more likely to solve logic problems that involve detecting cheating (a common problem given humans' social nature) than the same logic problem put in purely abstract terms. Since the ancestors of present-day humans did not encounter truly random events and lived under simpler life terms, present-day humans may be cognitively predisposed to incorrectly identify patterns in random sequences. ""Gamblers' Fallacy"" is one","Based on the context, the three major problems faced by the ancestors of present-day humans were:

Daniel Povinelli suggests that large, tree-climbing apes evolved consciousness to take into account one's own mass when moving safely among tree branches

. The field of evolutionary neuroscience has been shaped by the development of new techniques that allow for the discovery and examination of parts of the nervous system. In 1873, C. Golgi devised the silver nitrate method which allowed for the description of the brain at the cellular level as opposed to simply the gross level. Santiago and Pedro Ramon used this method to analyze numerous parts of brains, broadening the field of comparative neuroanatomy

What type of circuitry is thought to have originally evolved in pre-mammalian species?,Recursive circuitry,". In contrast, others have argued that the recursive circuitry underwriting consciousness is much more primitive, having evolved initially in pre-mammalian species because it improves the capacity for interaction with both social and natural environments by providing an energy-saving ""neutral"" gear in an otherwise energy-expensive motor output machine

The brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee, although it has been suggested that this was the time in which the human SRGAP2 gene doubled, producing a more rapid wiring of the frontal cortex

. Instead, new research speculates that all mammals, and potentially reptiles, birds and some species of fish, evolve from a common order pattern. This research reinforces the idea that human brains are structurally no t any different from many other organisms.(p 19–21) The cerebral cortex of reptiles resembles that of mammals, although simplified

What types of primates demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests according to Gordon Gallup?,Chimpanzees and orangutans,". Consistent with this hypothesis, Gordon Gallup found that chimpanzees and orangutans, but not little monkeys or terrestrial gorillas, demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests. The concept of consciousness can refer to voluntary action, awareness, or wakefulness. However, even voluntary behavior involves unconscious mechanisms. Many cognitive processes take place in the cognitive unconscious, unavailable to conscious awareness

. The consciousness of self and feelings represents the stage immediately prior to the external, phonetic expression of feelings in the form of sound (i.e. language). Intelligent animals such as dolphins, Eurasian magpies, and chimpanzees live in communities, wherein they assign themselves roles for group survival and show emotions such as sympathy. When such animals view their reflection (mirror test), they recognize themselves and exhibit self-consciousness

. Moreover, Baron-Cohen argues that many primates show some, but not all, of these abilities. Call and Tomasello's research on chimpanzees supports this, in that individual chimps seem to understand that other chimps have awareness, knowledge, and intention, but do not seem to understand false beli","According to the context, chimpanzees and orangutans demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests, while little monkeys or terrestrial gorillas did not.",0.8,0.5,0.7,0.6,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the species that demonstrated self-awareness in the mirror test, but its answer is not as specific as the ground truth answer.

What is the example mentioned in the context for an unconscious behavior?,turning right when riding a bike,". Some behaviors are conscious when learned but then become unconscious, seemingly automatic. Learning, especially implicitly learning a skill, can take place seemingly outside of consciousness. For example, plenty of people know how to turn right when they ride a bike, but very few can accurately explain how they actually do so. Evolutionary psychology approaches self-deception as an adaptation that can improve one's results in social exchanges

. For example, an on-edge soldier believes a young child with a stick is a grown man with a gun, as the brain's sympathetic system, or fight-or-flight mode, is activated. An example of this phenomenon can be observed in the rabbit-duck illusion. Depending on how the image is looked at, the brain can interpret the image of a rabbit, or a duck. There is no right or wrong answer, but it is proof that what is seen may not be the reality of the situation

What is the primary purpose of depth perception according to evolutionary psychologists?,To guide action,". Sleep may have evolved to conserve energy when activity would be less fruitful or more dangerous, such as at night, and especially during the winter season. Many experts, such as Jerry Fodor, write that the purpose of perception is knowledge, but evolutionary psychologists hold that its primary purpose is to guide action. For example, they say, depth perception seems to have evolved not to help us know the distances to other objects but rather to help us move around in space

. Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world. Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects. Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects

"According to evolutionary psychologists, what is the primary function of eyesight in animals?",directing action,". Evolutionary psychologists say that animals from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance, suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge. Building and maintaining sense organs is metabolically expensive, so these organs evolve only when they improve an organism's fitness

For example, they say, depth perception seems to have evolved not to help us know the distances to other objects but rather to help us move around in space

. For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light. Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make. Evolutionary psychologists contend that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity, with specialized me","According to evolutionary psychologists, the primary function of eyesight in animals is to direct action, not provide knowledge. In other words, vision's main purpose is to help guide behavior and avoid collisions, rather than convey information about the environment.",0.8,0.5,0.7,0.3,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the main function of eyesight as directing action, but its relevance and similarity scores are lower than those for the correct answer."
What percentage of one's metabolic resources does the brain consume?,One-fourth,". Paleontology has yet to explain the expansion of this organ over millions of years despite being extremely demanding in terms of energy consumption. The brain of a modern human consumes, on average, about 13 watts (260 kilocalories per day), a fifth of the body's resting power consumption. Increased tool use would allow hunting for energy-rich meat products, and would enable processing more energy-rich plant products

."" Respiration through bipedality means that there is better breath control in bipeds, which can be associated with brain growth. The modern brain utilizes approximately 20% of energy input gained through breathing and eating, as opposed to species like chimpanzees who use up twice as much energy as humans for the same amount of movement. This excess energy, leading to brain growth, also leads to the development of verbal communication

. More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information, and the brain itself consumes roughly one-fourth of one's metabolic resources, so the senses must provide exceptional benefits to fitness. Perception accurately mirrors the world; animals get useful, accurate information through their senses. Scientists who stud","According to the context, the brain consumes ""roughly one-fourth"" of one's metabolic resources.",0.8,0.7,0.85,0.7,0.9,"The answer is somewhat accurate, but it should specify that the brain consumes a significant portion of the body's energy resources, not a fifth."
What type of cues are used for depth perception?,Visual cues,". Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world. Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects. Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects

. Vision allows humans to process the world surrounding them to a certain extent. Through the wavelengths of light, the human brain can associate them to a specific event. Although the brain obviously perceives its surroundings at a specific moment, the brain equally predicts the upcoming changes in the environment.(p 66, 72) Once it has noticed them, the brain begins to prepare itself to encounter the new scenario by attempting to develop an adequate response

What determines the range over which an animal hears?,adaptation,". Larger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their size. The range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation. Homing pigeons, for example, can hear the very low-pitched sound (infrasound) that carries great distances, even though most smaller animals detect higher-pitched sounds. Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that are thought to have been significant for fitness in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness

. If something moves, they know approximately where it is and by the tone of it, the brain can predict what moved. If someone were to hear leaves rustling in a forest, the brain might interpret that sound as being an animal which could be a dangerous factor, but it would simply be another person walking. The brain can predict many things based on what it is interpreting, however, those predictions may not all be true

. This is because the evolution of humans to an upright position shifted the head directly above the spinal cord, forcing everything else downward. The repositioning of the larynx resulted in a longer cavity called the pharynx, which is responsible for increasing the range and ","According to the context, adaptation determines the range over which an animal hears.",0.8,0.5,0.7,0.6,0.9,The LLM's answer provides the correct term but uses a different definition. It should have mentioned that the range of hearing is determined by adaptation.
What is an example of a valuable substance that humans have an intrinsic hunger for?,Salt and sugar,". For example, salt and sugar were apparently both valuable to the human or pre-human inhabitants of the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, so present-day humans have an intrinsic hunger for salty and sweet tastes. The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain. Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive. An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation

. One example is the evolutionary psychology model of extended social groups selecting for modern human brains, a contradiction being that the synaptic function of modern human brains require high amounts of many specific essential nutrients so that such a transition to higher requirements of the same essential nutrients being shared by all individuals in a population would decrease the possibility of forming large groups due to bottleneck foods with rare essential nutrients capping group sizes

For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light. Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make. Evolutionary psychologists contend that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity, with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks

What is prosopagnosia?,A specific defect where people with damage to a particular part of the brain are unable to recognize faces,". For example, people with damage to a particular part of the brain have the specific defect of not being able to recognize faces (prosopagnosia). Evolutionary psychology suggests that this indicates a so-called face-reading module. In evolutionary psychology, learning is said to be accomplished through evolved capacities, specifically facultative adaptations. Facultative adaptations express themselves differently depending on input from the environment

. Therefore, in social animals, the neocortex came under intense selection to increase in size to improve social cognitive abilities. Social animals, such as humans, are capable of two important concepts, coalition formation, or group living, and tactical deception, which is a tactic of presenting false information to others

. For example, an on-edge soldier believes a young child with a stick is a grown man with a gun, as the brain's sympathetic system, or fight-or-flight mode, is activated. An example of this phenomenon can be observed in the rabbit-duck illusion. Depending on how the image is looked at, the brain can interpret the image of a rabbit, or a duck.

What is the example of how the input comes during development and helps shape that development?,Migrating birds learning to orient themselves by the stars during a critical period in their maturation.,". Sometimes the input comes during development and helps shape that development. For example, migrating birds learn to orient themselves by the stars during a critical period in their maturation. Evolutionary psychologists believe that humans also learn language along an evolved program, also with critical periods. The input can also come during daily tasks, helping the organism cope with changing environmental conditions

. Among the issues identified is the lack of distinction between what trait developed and how it is used, and the underlying reasons or forces that created the novel trait initially. This is particularly difficult to access in intangible language and cognition. This debate has continued over decades and most often presents in the form of a response and published dialogue between theorists. This continued debate has prompted efforts to marry the two perspectives in a useful way

What is an example of how animals evolved?,Pavlovian conditioning,". For example, animals evolved Pavlovian conditioning in order to solve problems about causal relationships. Animals accomplish learning tasks most easily when those tasks resemble problems that they faced in their evolutionary past, such as a rat learning where to find food or water. Learning capacities sometimes demonstrate differences between the sexes

. The Holozoa lineage of eukaryotes evolves many features for making cell colonies, and finally leads to the ancestor of animals (metazoans) and choanoflagellates. Proterospongia (members of the Choanoflagellata) are the best living examples of what the ancestor of all animals may have looked like. They live in colonies, and show a primitive level of cellular specialization for different tasks

. Evolution shows how certain environments and surroundings will favor the development of specific cognitive functions of the brain to aid an animal or in this case human to successfully live in that environment. Cognitive specialization in a theory in which cognitive functions, such as the ability to communicate socially, can be passed down genetically through offspring. This would benefit species in the process of natural selection

Who began a line of research suggesting that many emotions are universal?,Paul Ekman,". In many animal species, for example, males can solve spatial problems faster and more accurately than females, due to the effects of male hormones during development. The same might be true of humans. Motivations direct and energize behavior, while emotions provide the affective component to motivation, positive or negative. In the early 1970s, Paul Ekman and colleagues began a line of research which suggests that many emotions are universal

What is the neurobiological basis of motivation mentioned in the context?,the reward system of the brain,". Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status. Motivation has a neurobiological basis in the reward system of the brain. Recently, it has been suggested that reward systems may evolve in such a way that there may be an inherent or unavoidable trade-off in the motivational system for activities of short versus long duration

"According to evolutionary psychology, what type of strategies do humans use for problem-solving?",heuristics,". These evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behavior is the output of psychological adaptations that evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments. Some evolutionary psychologists argue that evolutionary theory can provide a foundational, metatheoretical framework that integrates the entire field of psychology in the same way evolutionary biology has for biology

. Cognition refers to internal representations of the world and internal information processing. From an evolutionary psychology perspective, cognition is not ""general purpose"". Cognition uses heuristics, or strategies, that generally increase the likelihood of solving problems that the ancestors of present-day humans routinely faced in their lives

. Evolutionary psychology is primarily interested in finding commonalities between people, or basic human psychological nature. From an evolutionary perspective, the fact that people have fundamental differences in personality traits initially presents something of a puzzle.

What is evolutionary psychology primarily interested in finding?,"Commonalities between people, or basic human psychological nature",". Evolutionary psychology is primarily interested in finding commonalities between people, or basic human psychological nature. From an evolutionary perspective, the fact that people have fundamental differences in personality traits initially presents something of a puzzle.

What happens to shared environmental influences on personality after adolescence?,They decrease to near zero,". For example, later-born children are more likely than firstborns to be rebellious, less conscientious and more open to new experiences, which may be advantageous to them given their particular niche in family structure. Shared environmental influences do play a role in personality and are not always of less importance than genetic factors. However, shared environmental influences often decrease to near zero after adolescence but do not completely disappear

They focus on plasticity between stages of development and the factors that shape it. Rate of maturation, fecundity, and fertility were all impacted by environmental circumstances. They argue that early maturation can be positive, reflecting opportunistic actions within specific conditions

. Evolutionary speaking, there is great evidence suggesting a genetic groundwork for the concept of languages has been in place for millions of years, as with many other capabilities and behaviours observed today.

When did the unique allele of the FOXP2 gene first appear?,Between 100 and 200 thousand years ago,". Humans have a unique allele of this gene, which has otherwise been closely conserved through most of mammalian evolutionary history. This unique allele seems to have first appeared between 100 and 200 thousand years ago, and it is now all but universal in humans. However, the once-popular idea that FOXP2 is a 'grammar gene' or that it triggered the emergence of language in Homo sapiens is now widely discredited

. This seems to suggest selection against Neanderthal-derived traits. For example, the neighborhood of the gene FOXP2, affecting speech and language, shows no signs of Neanderthal inheritance whatsoever. Introgression of genetic variants acquired by Neanderthal admixture has different distributions in Europeans and East Asians, pointing to differences in selective pressures

. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain (as of 2003) whether or not this was due to some favorable genetic mutations, for example in the FOXP2 gene, linked to language and speech.

Do researchers argue that an innate grammar module is necessary to explain human language acquisition?,No,". Currently, several competing theories about the evolutionary origin of language coexist, none of them having achieved a general consensus.

What does Tomasello argue about how humans learn complex behavior?,Through experience,". Tomasello argues that studies of how children and primates actually acquire communicative skills suggest that humans learn complex behavior through experience, so that instead of a module specifically dedicated to language acquisition, language is acquired by the same cognitive mechanisms that are used to acquire all other kinds of socially transmitted behavior.

Does Tecumseh Fitch agree that language is an adaptation?,No,". Tecumseh Fitch, following Stephen J. Gould, argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptation. He criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptionist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether ""Language has evolved as an adaptation"" as being misleading

. The ""mother tongues"" hypothesis was proposed in 2004 as a possible solution to this problem. W. Tecumseh Fitch suggested that the Darwinian principle of ""kin selection""—the convergence of genetic interests between relatives—might be part of the answer. Fitch suggests that languages were originally ""mother tongues""

If the theory that language could have evolved as a single adaptation is accepted, the question becomes which of its many functions has been the basis of adaptation. Several evolutionary hypotheses have been posited: that language evolved for the purpose of social grooming, that it evolved as a way to show mating potential or that it evolved to form social contracts

. Scholars wishing to study the origins of language draw inferences from evidence such as the fossil record, archaeological evidence, and contemporary language diversity. They may also study language acquisition as well as comparisons between human language and systems of animal communication (particularly other primates)

. Two possible scenarios have been proposed for the development of language, one of which supports the gestural theory: The first perspective that language evolved from the calls of human ancestors seems logical because both humans and animals make sounds or cries.

Human mating, then, is of interest to evolutionary psychologists who aim to investigate evolved mechanisms to attract and secure mates

. Evolutionary psychology is primarily interested in finding commonalities between people, or basic human psychological nature. From an evolutionary perspective, the fact that people have fundamental differences in personality traits initially presents something of a puzzle.

What is the fundamental difference between males and females?,The size differences of gametes (anisogamy),". It has been found that both male and female personality traits differ on a large spectrum. Males had a higher rate of traits relating to dominance, tension, and directness. Females had higher rates organizational behavior and more emotional based characteristics. Evolutionary psychologists contrast their approach to what they term the ""standard social science model,"" according to which the mind is a general-purpose cognition device shaped almost entirely by culture

. In all living hominid species, males are more muscular, allowing them to have more strength and power. Human males have 61% more overall muscle mass compared to females. This greater muscle mass allows males to gain greater acceleration, speed, and more powerful striking movements. Compared to females, human males exhibit more same-sex aggression, which peaks in young adulthood

. In females, superiority in verbal abilities, higher rule obedience, socialisation, empathy and agreeableness can be presented as a reflection of the systemic conservation function of the female sex. Male superiority is mostly noted in exploratory abilities - in risk- and sensation seeking, spacial orientation, physical strength and higher ","Based on the context, the fundamental differences between males and females are:

Who proposed that anisogamy typically results in different levels of parental investment between the sexes?,Trivers,". Trivers noted that anisogamy typically results in different levels of parental investment between the sexes, with females initially investing more. Trivers proposed that this difference in parental investment leads to the sexual selection of different reproductive strategies between the sexes and to sexual conflict. For example, he suggested that the sex that invests less in offspring will generally compete for access to the higher-investing sex to increase their inclusive fitness

. Several lines of research have stemmed from this interest, such as studies of mate selection mate poaching, mate retention, mating preferences and conflict between the sexes. In 1972 Robert Trivers published an influential paper on sex differences that is now referred to as parental investment theory. The size differences of gametes (anisogamy) is the fundamental, defining difference between males (small gametes – sperm) and females (large gametes – ova)

Buss and Schmitt's (1993) sexual strategies theory proposed that, due to differential parental investment, humans have evolved sexually dimorphic adaptations related to ""sexual accessibility, fertility assessment, commitment seeking and avoidance, immediate and enduring resource procurement, paternity certainty, assessment of mate value, and parental investment

. This idea closely relates to that of the suggested need for increased photoprotection and is part of the most-commonly-accepted scientific explanation for the evolution of pigmentary traits. Sexual dimorphism suggests the presence of sexual selection. The earliest homininae were highly dimorphic and that this tendency lessened over the course of human evolution, suggesting humans have become more monogamous

.g., losing baby teeth, adolescence, etc.) or how events during the development of an individual may alter life-history trajectories. Evolutionary psychologists use several strategies to develop and test hypotheses about whether a psychological trait is likely to be an evolved adaptation. Buss (2011) notes that these methods include: Cross-cultural Consistency

"According to the strategic interference theory, what is a common emotional response that occurs when the preferred reproductive strategies of one sex interfere with those of the other?",Anger or jealousy,"."" Their strategic interference theory suggested that conflict between the sexes occurs when the preferred reproductive strategies of one sex interfere with those of the other sex, resulting in the activation of emotional responses such as anger or jealousy. Women are generally more selective when choosing mates, especially under long-term mating conditions

. In combination with higher birth and accidental death rates this pattern might be a reflection of the systemic variational function (testing the boundaries of beneficial characteristics) of the male sex. As a result, psychological sex differences might be influenced by a global tendency within a species to expand its norm of reaction, but at the same time to preserve the beneficial properties of the species

. This suggests that for men sexual infidelity would generally be more aversive than emotional infidelity because investing resources in another man's offspring does not lead to the propagation of their own genes.

However, under some circumstances, engaging in multiple sexual relationships can provide benefits to women as well, such as fertility insurance, trading up to better genes, reducing the risk of inbreeding, and insurance protection of her offspring.

What is one reason why women may prefer a mate who can offer resources?,a woman risks losing such resources with a mate who commits emotional infidelity,". This particular pattern is predicted because the costs involved in mating for each sex are distinct. Women, on average, should prefer a mate who can offer resources (e.g., financial, commitment), thus, a woman risks losing such resources with a mate who commits emotional infidelity. Men, on the other hand, are never certain of the genetic paternity of their children because they do not bear the offspring themselves

What is the approximate time frame during which a woman's ovulatory phase occurs?,Days 10-15 of a woman's cycle,". Known as the ovulatory shift hypothesis, the theory posits that, during the ovulatory phase of a woman's cycle (approximately days 10–15 of a woman's cycle), a woman who mated with a male with high genetic quality would have been more likely, on average, to produce and bear a healthy offspring than a woman who mated with a male with low genetic quality

. These putative preferences are predicted to be especially apparent for short-term mating domains because a potential male mate would only be offering genes to a potential offspring. This hypothesis allows researchers to examine whether women select mates who have characteristics that indicate high genetic quality during the high fertility phase of their ovulatory cycles. Indeed, studies have shown that women's preferences vary across the ovulatory cycle

. Facial and vocal attractiveness have been observed to change with estradiol and progesterone in pattens consistent with fertility-related increases, although some data challenge this interpretation.

"What are the consequences of parental investment on an individual's future condition, survival, and reproductive output?",It may be detrimental,". Individuals are limited in the degree to which they can devote time and resources to producing and raising their young, and such expenditure may also be detrimental to their future condition, survival and further reproductive output. Parental investment is any parental expenditure (time, energy etc.) that benefits one offspring at a cost to parents' ability to invest in other components of fitness (Clutton-Brock 1991: 9; Trivers 1972)

. Components of fitness (Beatty 1992) include the well-being of existing offspring, parents' future reproduction, and inclusive fitness through aid to kin (Hamilton, 1964). Parental investment theory is a branch of life history theory. The benefits of parental investment to the offspring are large and are associated with the effects on condition, growth, survival, and ultimately, on the reproductive success of the offspring

. However, these benefits can come at the cost of the parent's ability to reproduce in the future e.g. through the increased risk of injury when defending offspring against predators, the loss of mating opportunities whilst rearing offspring, and an increase in the time to the next reproduction. Overall, parents are selected to","The consequences of parental investment on an individual's future condition, survival, and reproductive output are:

What is one component of fitness mentioned in the context?,The well-being of existing offspring,". More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information, and the brain itself consumes roughly one-fourth of one's metabolic resources, so the senses must provide exceptional benefits to fitness. Perception accurately mirrors the world; animals get useful, accurate information through their senses. Scientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations to their surrounding worlds

Parental investment theory is a branch of life history theory. The benefits of parental investment to the offspring are large and are associated with the effects on condition, growth, survival, and ultimately, on the reproductive success of the offspring

. It is closely linked to sociobiology, but there are key differences between them including the emphasis on domain-specific rather than domain-general mechanisms, the relevance of measures of current fitness, the importance of mismatch theory, and psychology rather than behavior.

The characteristics of the niche are largely the same as for social mammals, who evolved over 30 million years ago: soothing perinatal experience, several years of on-request breastfeeding, nearly constant affection or physical proximity, responsiveness to need (mitigating offspring distress), self-directed play, and for humans, multiple responsive caregivers. Initial studies show the importance of these components in early life for positive child outcomes

What are some of the adaptive problems that parents face?,Accurate identification of one's offspring and the allocation of one's resources among them,". The adaptive problems that challenge parental decision-making include both the accurate identification of one's offspring and the allocation of one's resources among them with sensitivity to their needs and abilities to convert parental investment into fitness increments…

. In broad terms, these problems include those of growth, development, differentiation, maintenance, mating, parenting, and social relationships. The environment of evolutionary adaptedness is significantly different from modern society. The ancestors of modern humans lived in smaller groups, had more cohesive cultures, and had more stable and rich contexts for identity and meaning

What is the sum of an organism's classical fitness and the number of equivalents of its own offspring?,Inclusive fitness,".

. Evolutionary biology as an academic discipline emerged with the modern synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s. In the 1930s the study of animal behavior (ethology) emerged with the work of the Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen and the Austrian biologists Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch. W.D.

What is the mathematical principle that explains how natural selection can perpetuate altruism?,Hamilton's rule,". Hamilton's rule describes mathematically whether or not a gene for altruistic behavior will spread in a population: The concept serves to explain how natural selection can perpetuate altruism

. These theories help to explain the development of altruistic behavior, and account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism). Several mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The r/K selection theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring, while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy

. According to Hamilton's rule, self-sacrificing behaviors (and the genes influencing them) can evolve if they typically help the organism's close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice. Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how altruism can evolve.

What is the topic being distinguished from in the context?,The green-beard effect,". Among the issues identified is the lack of distinction between what trait developed and how it is used, and the underlying reasons or forces that created the novel trait initially. This is particularly difficult to access in intangible language and cognition. This debate has continued over decades and most often presents in the form of a response and published dialogue between theorists. This continued debate has prompted efforts to marry the two perspectives in a useful way

. And, as exemplified by the finches, such de-differentiations can occur in very rapid time-frames. A distinction can be drawn between speech and language. Language is not necessarily spoken: it might alternatively be written or signed. Speech is among a number of different methods of encoding and transmitting linguistic information, albeit arguably[by whom?] the most natural one

What evolutionary game theory concept proposes that cooperation can be maintained with non-kin via mutually beneficial reciprocity?,Mutually beneficial reciprocity,". Although interactions with non-kin are generally less altruistic compared to those with kin, cooperation can be maintained with non-kin via mutually beneficial reciprocity as was proposed by Robert Trivers. If there are repeated encounters between the same two players in an evolutionary game in which each of them can choose either to ""cooperate"" or ""defect"", then a strategy of mutual cooperation may be favored even if it pays each player, in the short term, to defect when the other cooperates

. Direct reciprocity can lead to the evolution of cooperation only if the probability, w, of another encounter between the same two individuals exceeds the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act: Reciprocity can also be indirect if information about previous interactions is shared.

What is the evolutionary purpose of moral indignation?,to prevent one's altruism from being exploited by cheaters,". Liking and disliking, he says, evolved to help present-day humans' ancestors form coalitions with others who reciprocated and to exclude those who did not reciprocate. Moral indignation may have evolved to prevent one's altruism from being exploited by cheaters, and gratitude may have motivated present-day humans' ancestors to reciprocate appropriately after benefiting from others' altruism. Likewise, present-day humans feel guilty when they fail to reciprocate

. De Waal contends that all social animals have had to restrain or alter their behavior for group living to be worthwhile. Pre-moral sentiments evolved in primate societies as a method of restraining individual selfishness and building more cooperative groups.

What do evolutionary psychologists expect to see in adaptations that evolved to maximize the benefits and minimize the drawbacks of reciprocity?,social motivations matching what is seen,". These social motivations match what evolutionary psychologists expect to see in adaptations that evolved to maximize the benefits and minimize the drawbacks of reciprocity. Evolutionary psychologists say that humans have psychological adaptations that evolved specifically to help us identify nonreciprocators, commonly referred to as ""cheaters

. Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations, including the abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, and cooperate with others. Findings have been made regarding human social behaviour related to infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price, and parental investment

. Evolutionary psychology also recognizes the role of kin selection and reciprocity in evolving prosocial traits such as altruism. Like chimpanzees and bonobos, humans have subtle and flexible social instincts, allowing them to form extended families, lifelong friendships, and political alliances

In what year did an experiment show that people were better at remembering the faces of people when those faces were associated with stories about those individuals cheating?,1996,"."" In 1993, Robert Frank and his associates found that participants in a prisoner's dilemma scenario were often able to predict whether their partners would ""cheat"", based on a half-hour of unstructured social interaction. In a 1996 experiment, for example, Linda Mealey and her colleagues found that people were better at remembering the faces of people when those faces were associated with stories about those individuals cheating (such as embezzling money from a church)

. For example, present-day humans are far more likely to solve logic problems that involve detecting cheating (a common problem given humans' social nature) than the same logic problem put in purely abstract terms. Since the ancestors of present-day humans did not encounter truly random events and lived under simpler life terms, present-day humans may be cognitively predisposed to incorrectly identify patterns in random sequences. ""Gamblers' Fallacy"" is one example of this

"According to evolutionary psychologists, what happens to the innate modules in the human brain after they are developed?",They are activated by some environmental event,". Evolutionary psychologists, for example, believe that the human brain is made up of innate modules, each of which is specialised only for very specific tasks, e. g. an anxiety module. According to evolutionary psychologists, these modules are given before the organism actually develops and are then activated by some environmental event

."" Evolutionary psychologists generally presume that, like the body, the mind is made up of many evolved modular adaptations, although there is some disagreement within the discipline regarding the degree of general plasticity, or ""generality,"" of some modules. It has been suggested that modularity evolves because, compared to non-modular networks, it would have conferred an advantage in terms of fitness and because connection costs are lower

While philosophers have generally considered the human mind to include broad faculties, such as reason and lust, evolutionary psychologists describe evolved psychological mechanisms as narrowly focused to deal with specific issues, such as catching cheaters or choosing mates.

What is a criticism of the idea that cognitive specialization only comes about through distant ancestors' environment?,That it is reductionist,". Critics object that this view is reductionist and that cognitive specialisation only comes about through the interaction of humans with their real environment, rather than the environment of distant ancestors. Interdisciplinary approaches are increasingly striving to mediate between these opposing points of view and to highlight that biological and cultural causes need not be antithetical in explaining human behaviour and even complex cultural achievements

. Evolution shows how certain environments and surroundings will favor the development of specific cognitive functions of the brain to aid an animal or in this case human to successfully live in that environment. Cognitive specialization in a theory in which cognitive functions, such as the ability to communicate socially, can be passed down genetically through offspring. This would benefit species in the process of natural selection

"According to Paul Baltes, what happens to the benefits granted by evolutionary selection with age?",They decrease,". According to Paul Baltes, the benefits granted by evolutionary selection decrease with age. Natural selection has not eliminated many harmful conditions and nonadaptive characteristics that appear among older adults, such as Alzheimer disease. If it were a disease that killed 20-year-olds instead of 70-year-olds this might have been a disease that natural selection could have eliminated ages ago

. However, these benefits can come at the cost of the parent's ability to reproduce in the future e.g. through the increased risk of injury when defending offspring against predators, the loss of mating opportunities whilst rearing offspring, and an increase in the time to the next reproduction. Overall, parents are selected to maximize the difference between the benefits and the costs, and parental care will likely evolve when the benefits exceed the costs

. Hawks et al. (2007) argue that demographic changes (particularly population expansion) may greatly facilitate adaptive evolution, an argument that somewhat corroborates the positive correlation inferred between population size and amount of adaptive evolution occurring mentioned previously.

When do humans typically show determination?,at an early age,". When endeavouring to solve a problem humans at an early age show determination while chimpanzees have no comparable facial expression. Researchers suspect the human determined expression evolved because when a human is determinedly working on a problem other people will frequently help. Adaptationist hypotheses regarding the etiology of psychological disorders are often based on analogies between physiological and psychological dysfunctions, as noted in the table below

. Sometimes the input comes during development and helps shape that development. For example, migrating birds learn to orient themselves by the stars during a critical period in their maturation. Evolutionary psychologists believe that humans also learn language along an evolved program, also with critical periods. The input can also come during daily tasks, helping the organism cope with changing environmental conditions

Prominent theorists and evolutionary psychiatrists include Michael T. McGuire, Anthony Stevens, and Randolph M. Nesse. They, and others, suggest that mental disorders are due to the interactive effects of both nature and nurture, and often have multiple contributing causes. Evolutionary psychologists have suggested that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder may reflect a side-effect of genes with fitness benefits, such as increased creativity

Which group is found to be more likely to have creative professions?,The close relatives of people with schizophrenia,". (Some individuals with bipolar disorder are especially creative during their manic phases and the close relatives of people with schizophrenia have been found to be more likely to have creative professions

. In particular, Haselton and Miller (2006) showed that highly fertile women prefer creative but poor men as short-term mates. Creativity may be a proxy for good genes. Research by Gangestad et al. (2004) indicates that highly fertile women prefer men who display social presence and intrasexual competition; these traits may act as cues that would help women predict which men may have, or would be able to acquire, resources. Reproduction is always costly for women, and can also be for men

. For example, schizophrenia has been linked with increased creativity (Crespi et al. 2007), perhaps a useful trait for obtaining food or attracting mates in Palaeolithic times. Alternatively, the adaptive mutations may be the ones which reduce the chance of disease arising due to other mutations. However, this second explanation seems unlikely, because the mutation rate in the human genome is fairly low, so selection would be relatively weak

Paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner of the Smithsonian Institution noted that cultural factors could play a role in the widely different rates of C-sections across the developed and developing worlds. Daghni Rajasingam of the Royal College of Obstetricians observed that the increasing rates of diabetes and obesity among women of reproductive age also boost the demand for C-sections

What is the name of the evolutionary theory linked to psychological and behavioral sex differences?,Geodakyan's evolutionary theory of sex,". Evolutionary psychology has been applied to explain criminal or otherwise immoral behavior as being adaptive or related to adaptive behaviors. Males are generally more aggressive than females, who are more selective of their partners because of the far greater effort they have to contribute to pregnancy and child-rearing. Males being more aggressive is hypothesized to stem from the more intense reproductive competition faced by them

. It has been found that both male and female personality traits differ on a large spectrum. Males had a higher rate of traits relating to dominance, tension, and directness. Females had higher rates organizational behavior and more emotional based characteristics. Evolutionary psychologists contrast their approach to what they term the ""standard social science model,"" according to which the mind is a general-purpose cognition device shaped almost entirely by culture

In combination with higher birth and accidental death rates this pattern might be a reflection of the systemic variational function (testing the boundaries of beneficial characteristics) of the male sex. As a result, psychological sex differences might be influenced by a global tenden","Based on the context, the answer would be:

What is the concept that suggests sex differentiation in a species creates two partitions?,Conservational (females) and Variational (males),". She pointed out that a pattern of consistent sex differences in physical, verbal and social dis/abilities corresponds to the idea of the ETS considering sex dimorphism as a functional specialization of a species. Sex differentiation, according to the ETS, creates two partitions within a species, (1) conservational (females), and (2) variational (males)

. She suggested that the variational function of the ""male partition"" might also provide irrelevance/redundancy pruning of an excess in a bank of beneficial characteristics of a species, with a continuing resistance to any changes from the norm-driven conservational partition of species. This might explain a contradictory allocation of a high drive for social status/power in the male sex with the their least (among two sexes) abilities for social interaction

. Darwin noted that sexual selection is of two kinds and concluded that both kinds had operated on humans: ""The sexual struggle is of two kinds; in the one it is between the individuals of the same sex, generally the male sex, in order to drive away or kill their rivals, the females remaining passive; whilst in the other, the struggle is likewise between the individuals of th","According to the context, the concept that suggests sex differentiation in a species creates two partitions is ""the idea of the ETS considering sex dimorphism as a functional specialization of a species.""

It mentions the idea of sex dimorphism, but it does not provide a clear definition or explain how it creates two partitions within a species."
What is one area where males tend to show superiority over females?,Exploratory abilities,". In females, superiority in verbal abilities, higher rule obedience, socialisation, empathy and agreeableness can be presented as a reflection of the systemic conservation function of the female sex. Male superiority is mostly noted in exploratory abilities - in risk- and sensation seeking, spacial orientation, physical strength and higher rates in physical aggression

. Chimpanzees and humans have the greatest sexual dimorphism in fundamental frequency of all hominids. Males are also more likely to engage in physical risks in front of competitors, and males who take more physical risks are perceived as being stronger. Status badges such as facial hair are generally related to men being perceived as more dominant. Facial hair makes the jaw appear more prominent and shows emotions like anger clearly which makes a male appear more threatening

. It has been found that both male and female personality traits differ on a large spectrum. Males had a higher rate of traits relating to dominance, tension, and directness. Females had higher rates organizational behavior and more emotional based characteristics. Evolutionary psychologists contrast their approach to what they term the ""stand","According to the context, males tend to show superiority over females in exploratory abilities, specifically in risk- and sensation seeking, spatial orientation, physical strength, and higher rates of physical aggression.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.8,The LLM failed to accurately identify that males tend to show superiority over females in exploratory abilities.
Is the pattern of higher mortality and birth rates in males a reflection of systemic variational function?,True,". In combination with higher birth and accidental death rates this pattern might be a reflection of the systemic variational function (testing the boundaries of beneficial characteristics) of the male sex. As a result, psychological sex differences might be influenced by a global tendency within a species to expand its norm of reaction, but at the same time to preserve the beneficial properties of the species

. She suggested that the variational function of the ""male partition"" might also provide irrelevance/redundancy pruning of an excess in a bank of beneficial characteristics of a species, with a continuing resistance to any changes from the norm-driven conservational partition of species. This might explain a contradictory allocation of a high drive for social status/power in the male sex with the their least (among two sexes) abilities for social interaction

. Fitch argues that these two approaches can be rectified with the study of ""neutral computation and mammalian brain development"". It may be more useful to consider specific components of neural computation and development, what has been selected for, and to what end. Ploeger and Galis tackled modular evolvability and de","According to the context, yes, the pattern of higher mortality and birth rates in males is indeed a reflection of systemic variational function. This is mentioned in the first sentence as ""In combination with higher birth and accidental death rates this pattern might be a reflection of the systemic variational function..."".",1.0,1.0,0.95,0.8,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the relationship between higher mortality and birth rates in males and the systemic variational function as a potential cause. However, the context could be improved for a more accurate understanding by specifying the statistical tests used or the biological mechanisms involved."
What is one condition that Trofimova suggested has a higher rate in males compared to females?,Autism,". Moreover, Trofimova suggested a ""redundancy pruning"" hypothesis as an upgrade of the ETS theory. She pointed out to higher rates of psychopathy, dyslexia, autism and schizophrenia in males, in comparison to females

. In combination with higher birth and accidental death rates this pattern might be a reflection of the systemic variational function (testing the boundaries of beneficial characteristics) of the male sex. As a result, psychological sex differences might be influenced by a global tendency within a species to expand its norm of reaction, but at the same time to preserve the beneficial properties of the species

. Mild depression may be an adaptive response to withdraw from, and re-evaluate, situations that have led to disadvantageous outcomes (the ""analytical rumination hypothesis"") (see Evolutionary approaches to depression). Trofimova reviewed the most consistent psychological and behavioural sex differences in psychological abilities and disabilities and linked them to the Geodakyan's evolutionary theory of sex (ETS)

. There is further evidence from the same study that in fertile stages of the menstrual cycle, women also had a preference for other masculine traits ","According to the context, one condition that Trofimova suggested has a higher rate in males compared to females is psychopathy.",0.8,0.7,0.85,0.9,0.0,"The context mentions higher rates of psychopathy, dyslexia, autism and schizophrenia in males, in comparison to females, which could be a potential factor contributing to the higher rate observed in males in Trofimova's study."

What might facilitate males' higher rates of disengagement from normative expectations?,Their high rates of communicative disorders and psychopathy,". The high rates of communicative disorders and psychopathy in males might facilitate their higher rates of disengagement from normative expectations and their insensitivity to social disapproval, when they deliberately do not follow social norms. Some of these speculations have yet to be developed into fully testable hypotheses, and a great deal of research is required to confirm their validity

. Miller (2000) has proposed that this apparent redundancy is due to individuals using vocabulary to demonstrate their intelligence, and consequently their ""fitness"", to potential mates. This has been tested experimentally, and it appears that males do make greater use of lower-frequency (more unusual) words when in a romantic mindset compared to a non-romantic mindset, suggesting th","According to the context, the high rates of communicative disorders and psychopathy in males might facilitate their higher rates of disengagement from normative expectations.",0.8,0.9,0.7,0.6,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the fact that high rates of communicative disorders and psychopathy may be linked to males' higher rates of disengagement from normative expectations, but it could provide more specific examples or references to support the claim."
What is hypothesized to be the reason for males being more aggressive than females?,The far greater reproductive competition faced by them,". Evolutionary psychology has been applied to explain criminal or otherwise immoral behavior as being adaptive or related to adaptive behaviors. Males are generally more aggressive than females, who are more selective of their partners because of the far greater effort they have to contribute to pregnancy and child-rearing. Males being more aggressive is hypothesized to stem from the more intense reproductive competition faced by them

. A higher pain tolerance allows for males to remain aggressive during contests along with an increased aerobic capacity. Males have an oxygen capacity rate that is 25–30% higher than females. This aerobic capacity increases during puberty when males are sexually maturing and preparing to mate. Human males engage in both within-group contest competition and coalitional aggression

."" Their strategic interference theory suggested that conflict between the sexes occurs when the preferred reproductive strategies of one sex interfere with those of the other sex, resulting in the activation of emotional responses such as anger or jealousy. Women are generally more selective when choosing mates, especially under long-term mating conditions

Women are mor","According to the context, it is hypothesized that males' greater reproductive competition drives their higher aggression levels compared to females.",0.7,0.9,0.8,0.5,0.8,"The context focuses on evolutionary psychology and criminal behavior, which are not directly related to the question about gender differences in aggression."
Why are males generally involved in more crimes?,"According to the text, it may be because engaging in highly risky and violently aggressive behavior can increase their status and therefore reproductive success.",". Evolutionary psychology has been applied to explain criminal or otherwise immoral behavior as being adaptive or related to adaptive behaviors. Males are generally more aggressive than females, who are more selective of their partners because of the far greater effort they have to contribute to pregnancy and child-rearing. Males being more aggressive is hypothesized to stem from the more intense reproductive competition faced by them

. Males of low status may be especially vulnerable to being childless. It may have been evolutionary advantageous to engage in highly risky and violently aggressive behavior to increase their status and therefore reproductive success. This may explain why males are generally involved in more crimes, and why low status and being unmarried are associated with criminality

. Furthermore, competition over females is argued to have been particularly intensive in late adolescence and young adulthood, which is theorized to explain why crime rates are particularly high during this period. Some sociologists have underlined differential exposure to androgens as the cause of these behaviors, notably Lee Ellis in his evolutionary neuroandrogenic (ENA) theory. Ma","According to the context, males are generally involved in more crimes because engaging in highly risky and violently aggressive behavior may have been evolutionarily advantageous for low-status males to increase their status and therefore reproductive success.

The answer is more focused on the biological aspects of aggression and status without adequately addressing the context or the concept of reproductive success."
"According to the text, what is the age range during which competition over females is theorized to be particularly intensive?",Late adolescence and young adulthood,". Furthermore, competition over females is argued to have been particularly intensive in late adolescence and young adulthood, which is theorized to explain why crime rates are particularly high during this period. Some sociologists have underlined differential exposure to androgens as the cause of these behaviors, notably Lee Ellis in his evolutionary neuroandrogenic (ENA) theory. Many conflicts that result in harm and death involve status, reputation, and seemingly trivial insults

. Women are more likely to compete for desirable mates when maternal investment levels are high, and their social groups are largely composed of mothers, as more women living closer together are looking for similar resources that benefit their own survival and that of their children. Competition for mates among human females may take multiple forms. Contests tend to be less frequent, aggressive, and injurious than male-male contests. This leads to a difference in the traits selected

What is the main argument presented by Steven Pinker in his book The Better Angels of Our Nature?,"That non-state societies without a police needed a credible deterrence against aggression, leading to the development of instincts for revenge and protecting reputation",". Steven Pinker in his book The Better Angels of Our Nature argues that in non-state societies without a police it was very important to have a credible deterrence against aggression. Therefore, it was important to be perceived as having a credible reputation for retaliation, resulting in humans developing instincts for revenge as well as for protecting reputation (""honor"")

. Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important

. According to Steven Pinker, who builds on the work by Noam Chomsky, the universal human ability to learn to talk between the ages of 1 – 4, basically without training, suggests that language acquisition is a distinctly human psychological adaptation (see, in particular, Pinker's The Language Instinct)

What does Pinker argue has reduced the level of violence compared to the ancestral environment?,The development of the state and the police,". Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of violence compared to the ancestral environment.

Alcock argues that present-day evidence allows researchers to be reasonably confident about the conditions of the EEA and that the fact that so many human behaviours are adaptive in the current environment is evidence that the ancestral environment of humans had much in common with the present one, as these behaviours would have evolved in the ancestral environment.

What is one objection to sociobiological theories of rape?,That they do not consider rape to be a behavioral adaptation,". The sociobiological theories of rape are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider rape to be a behavioral adaptation, and objections to this theory are made on ethical, religious, political, as well as scientific grounds. Adaptationist perspectives on religious belief suggest that, like all behavior, religious behaviors are a product of the human brain

. Rape is theorized to be a reproductive strategy that facilitates the propagation of the rapist's progeny. Such a strategy may be adopted by men who otherwise are unlikely to be appealing to women and therefore cannot form legitimate relationships, or by high-status men on socially vulnerable women who are unlikely to retaliate to increase their reproductive success even further

. Critics have argued that evolutionary psychology might be used to justify existing social hierarchies and reactionary policies. It has also been suggested by critics that evolutionary psychologists' theories and interpretations of empirical data rely heavily on ideological assumptions about race and gender. In response to such criticism, evolutionary psychologists often caution against committing the naturalistic fallacy ",One objection to sociobiological theories of rape is that they can be used to justify existing social hierarchies and reactionary policies.,1.0,1.0,0.8,0.7,0.0,The LLM's answer provides a valid objection to sociobiological theories of rape by highlighting the potential for these theories to perpetuate existing social hierarchies and reactionary policies.
Is cognition's functional structure universally shared amongst humans?,true,". As with all other organ functions, cognition's functional structure has been argued to have a genetic foundation, and is therefore subject to the effects of natural selection and sexual selection. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared amongst humans and should have solved important problems of survival and reproduction in ancestral environments

. Cognition refers to internal representations of the world and internal information processing. From an evolutionary psychology perspective, cognition is not ""general purpose"". Cognition uses heuristics, or strategies, that generally increase the likelihood of solving problems that the ancestors of present-day humans routinely faced in their lives

. Instead, new research speculates that all mammals, and potentially reptiles, birds and some species of fish, evolve from a common order pattern. This research reinforces the idea that human brains are structurally no t any different from many other organisms.(p 19–21) The cerebral cortex of reptiles resembles that of mammals, although simplified

Fitch argues that these two approaches can be rectified with the study of ""neutral computation an","According to the context, yes, cognition's functional structure should be universally shared amongst humans.",1.0,0.8,0.7,0.9,0.0,The context provides a clear statement that cognition's functional structure should be universally shared amongst humans.
Is religious belief considered a direct result of evolutionary adaptations according to all evolutionary psychologists?,No,". However, evolutionary psychologists remain divided on whether religious belief is more likely a consequence of evolved psychological adaptations, or a byproduct of other cognitive adaptations. Coalitional psychology is an approach to explain political behaviors between different coalitions and the conditionality of these behaviors in evolutionary psychological perspective

. These evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behavior is the output of psychological adaptations that evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments. Some evolutionary psychologists argue that evolutionary theory can provide a foundational, metatheoretical framework that integrates the entire field of psychology in the same way evolutionary biology has for biology

. Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations, including the abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, and cooperate with others. Findings have been made regarding human social behaviour related to infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, pe","No. According to the context, evolutionary psychologists are ""divided"" on whether religious belief is more likely a consequence of evolved psychological adaptations or a byproduct of other cognitive adaptations, suggesting that not all evolutionary psychologists consider religious belief a direct result of evolutionary adaptations.",0.0,0.0,0.1,0.3,0.8,The context does not provide sufficient information to determine whether religious belief is a direct result of evolutionary adaptations.
What is the primary assumption behind this approach?,Human beings have evolved to live in groups instead of living as individuals.,". Humans follow the second strategy. Parental investment theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness

. The individual human brain has to explain a phenomenon in order to comprehend and relate to it. This activity predates by far the emergence of language and may have caused it. The theory is, belief in the supernatural emerges from hypotheses arbitrarily assumed by individuals to explain natural phenomena that cannot be explained otherwise. The resulting need to share individual hypotheses with others leads eventually to collective religious belief

. Critics of this theory point out that kin selection is not unique to humans. So even if one accepts Fitch's initial premises, the extension of the posited ""mother tongue"" networks from close relatives to more distant relatives remains unexplained

. If this is how grammar evolves today, according to this school of thought, similar principles at work can be legitimately inferred among distant human ancestors, when grammar itself was first being established. In order to reconstruct th","The primary assumption behind this approach is that individual humans have a natural tendency to try to explain and make sense of natural phenomena in order to comprehend and relate to them, which may have led to the emergence of language.",0.7,0.8,0.6,0.5,0.0,The passage explains the emergence of language as a means for individuals to explain and make sense of natural phenomena and relate to them.

What is one example of an evolutionary model mentioned in the context?,The evolutionary psychology model of extended social groups selecting for modern human brains,". One example is the evolutionary psychology model of extended social groups selecting for modern human brains, a contradiction being that the synaptic function of modern human brains require high amounts of many specific essential nutrients so that such a transition to higher requirements of the same essential nutrients being shared by all individuals in a population would decrease the possibility of forming large groups due to bottleneck foods with rare essential nutrients capping group sizes

In the case of the claim that a provider male could buy protection service for his family from other males by bartering food that he had hunted, critics point at the fact that the most valuable food (the food that contained the rarest essential nutrients) would be different in different ecologies and as such vegetable in some geographical areas and animal in others, making it impossible for hunting styles relying on physical strength or risk-taking to be universally of similar value in

. However, Hawkes does acknowledge inconsistencies across societies and contexts such as the fluctuating time courses dedicated to hunting and gathering, which are not directly correlated with return rates, the fact that nutrition value is often chosen over caloric count, and the fact that meat is a more widely spread resource than other resources. The show-off hypothesis is the concept that more successful men have better mate options

Is it pointless for a male to quickly assess female fertility if he needs to assess the risk of a jealous male mate?,True,". A contradiction between evolutionary psychology's claim of men needing to be more sexually visual than women for fast speed of assessing women's fertility than women needed to be able to assess the male's genes and its claim of male sexual jealousy guarding against infidelity is also pointed at, as it would be pointless for a male to be fast to assess female fertility if he needed to assess the risk of there being a jealous male mate and in that case his chances of defeating him before mating

case his chances of defeating him before mating anyway (pointlessness of assessing one necessary condition faster than another necessary condition can possibly be assessed)

. However, under some circumstances, engaging in multiple sexual relationships can provide benefits to women as well, such as fertility insurance, trading up to better genes, reducing the risk of inbreeding, and insurance protection of her offspring. Due to male paternity uncertainty, sex differences have been found in the domains of sexual jealousy. Females generally react more adversely to emotional infidelity and males will react more to sexual infidelity

This particular pattern is predicted because the costs invo","Yes, according to the context, it would be pointless for a male to quickly assess female fertility if he needed to assess the risk of a jealous male mate and in that case his chances of defeating him before mating anyway.",1.0,0.8,0.7,0.6,0.0,The answer correctly points out the potential ineffectiveness of quickly assessing female fertility in the context of assessing the risk of jealousy. The context also provides examples of evolutionary psychology's claim regarding men's need for visual assessment.
What is the topic being discussed in this context?,Mathematics or logic,". Among the issues identified is the lack of distinction between what trait developed and how it is used, and the underlying reasons or forces that created the novel trait initially. This is particularly difficult to access in intangible language and cognition. This debate has continued over decades and most often presents in the form of a response and published dialogue between theorists. This continued debate has prompted efforts to marry the two perspectives in a useful way

. A further criticism is that language does not work on the basis of reciprocal altruism anyway. Humans in conversational groups do not withhold information to all except listeners likely to offer valuable information in return. On the contrary, they seem to want to advertise to the world their access to socially relevant information, broadcasting that information without expectation of reciprocity to anyone who will listen

What is a term used by evolutionary psychologists to refer to their opposing viewpoint?,The Standard Social Science Model (SSSM),". Evolutionary psychology has been entangled in the larger philosophical and social science controversies related to the debate on nature versus nurture. Evolutionary psychologists typically contrast evolutionary psychology with what they call the standard social science model (SSSM)

. David Buller observed that the term ""evolutionary psychology"" is sometimes seen as denoting research based on the specific methodological and theoretical commitments of certain researchers from the Santa Barbara school (University of California), thus some evolutionary psychologists prefer to term their work ""human ecology"", ""human behavioural ecology"" or ""evolutionary anthropology"" instead. From psychology there are the primary streams of developmental, social and cognitive psychology

. Coalitional psychology offers falsifiable ex ante prediction by positing five hypotheses on how these psychological adaptations operate: Critics of evolutionary psychology accuse it of promoting genetic determinism, pan-adaptationism (the idea that all behaviors and anatomical features are adaptations), unfalsifiable hypotheses, distal or ultimate explanations of behavior when proximate explanations are superior, a","According to the context, the opposing viewpoint referred to by evolutionary psychologists is called ""the standard social science model"" (SSSM).",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.7,1.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the term 'Standard Social Science Model' as an opposing viewpoint to the term 'Evolutionary Psychology'.

. Although Saussure put much focus on diachronic linguistics, later structuralists who equated structuralism with the synchronic analysis were sometimes criticised of ahistoricism. According to structural anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, language and meaning—in opposition to ""knowledge, which develops slowly and progressively""—must have appeared in an instant

Critics of the speech/ritual co-evolution idea theory include Noam Chomsky, who terms it the ""non-existence"" hypothesis—a denial of the very existence of language as an object of study for natural science.

. Multiregionalists have responded to what they see as flaws in the Eve theory, and have offered contrary genetic evidences. Wu and Thorne have questioned the reliability of the molecular clock used to date Eve. Multiregionalists point out that Mitochondrial DNA alone can not rule out interbreeding between early modern and archaic humans, since archaic human mitochondrial strains from such interbreeding could have been lost due to genetic drift or a selective sweep

What is the primary focus of evolutionary psychology?,The evolution of psychological adaptations,". Evolutionary psychology is primarily interested in finding commonalities between people, or basic human psychological nature. From an evolutionary perspective, the fact that people have fundamental differences in personality traits initially presents something of a puzzle. (Note: The field of behavioral genetics is concerned with statistically partitioning differences between people into genetic and environmental sources of variance

. Evolutionary psychology focuses primarily on the ""why?"" questions, while traditional psychology focuses on the ""how?"" questions. Evolutionary psychology is founded on several core premises. Evolutionary psychology has its historical roots in Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. In The Origin of Species, Darwin predicted that psychology would develop an evolutionary basis: In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches

What is the primary focus of the field of behavioral genetics?,The study of the proximate influence of genes on behavior,". The field of behavioral genetics is focused on the study of the proximate influence of genes on behavior. A frequent critique of the discipline is that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychology are frequently arbitrary and difficult or impossible to adequately test, thus questioning its status as an actual scientific discipline, for example because many current traits probably evolved to serve different functions than they do now

. Establishing some measure of the relative influence of genetics and environment on behavior has been at the core of behavioral genetics and its variants, notably studies at the molecular level that examine the relationship between genes, neurotransmitters and behavior

. Conceptually and theoretically, the field is related to fields as diverse as cognitive genomics, neurogenetics, developmental neuroscience, neuroethology, comparative psychology, evo-devo, behavioral neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, behavioral ecology, biological anthropology and sociobiology. Evolutionary neuroscientists examine changes in genes, anatomy, physiology, and behavior to study the evolution of changes in the brain

What was the primary lifestyle of Homo sapiens' ancestors?,Hunter-gatherers,". It is suspected that H. sapiens ancestors’ did not initially forage on the forest floor; instead they migrated from the trees for various reasons. In that environment, they survived on a diet high in plant matter with some insects and little amounts of meat

--- # Human evolution Homo sapiens is a distinct species of the hominid family of primates, which also includes all the great apes. Over their evolutionary history, humans gradually developed traits such as bipedalism, dexterity, and complex language, as well as interbreeding with other hominins (a tribe of the African hominid subfamily), indicating that human evolution was not linear but weblike

. The specific study of the origin and life of humans is anthropology, particularly paleoanthropology which focuses on the study of human prehistory. The closest living relatives of humans are bonobos and chimpanzees (both genus Pan) and gorillas (genus Gorilla). With the sequencing of both the human and chimpanzee genome, as of 2012[update] estimates of the similarity between their DNA sequences range between 95% and 99%.

This raises an important issue, which is that many of these tests for adaptive evolution are very weak

. Therefore, the fact that many estimates are at (or very near to) 0% does not rule out the occurrence of any adaptive evolution in the human genome, but simply shows that positive selection is not frequent enough to be detected by the tests.

What does Dominic Murphy propose for evaluating alternative explanations?,They require their own evidence and predictions,". Similarly, Dominic Murphy argues that alternative explanations cannot just be forwarded but instead need their own evidence and predictions - if one explanation makes predictions that the others cannot, it is reasonable to have confidence in that explanation

. To support these claims, he points to things like the bi-directionality in language usage and comprehension. This is a counter to the claims by theorists like Noam Chomsky, who argued against language as a human specific adaptation. Adaptation and adaptive theory has been argued even separate from its utility in the study of language. Gould and Lewontin engage with what they saw as flaws in adaptive theory using the analogy of the spandrels of San Marco

. Critics of this theory point out that kin selection is not unique to humans. So even if one accepts Fitch's initial premises, the extension of the posited ""mother tongue"" networks from close relatives to more distant relatives remains unexplained

What is the primary reason why evolutionary psychologists suggest that modularity evolves?,It would have conferred an advantage in terms of fitness,"."" Evolutionary psychologists generally presume that, like the body, the mind is made up of many evolved modular adaptations, although there is some disagreement within the discipline regarding the degree of general plasticity, or ""generality,"" of some modules. It has been suggested that modularity evolves because, compared to non-modular networks, it would have conferred an advantage in terms of fitness and because connection costs are lower

. Evolutionary psychologists, for example, believe that the human brain is made up of innate modules, each of which is specialised only for very specific tasks, e. g. an anxiety module.

What type of cognitive task has been used to provide empirical support for the domain-specific theory?,The Wason selection task,". In contrast, some academics argue that it is unnecessary to posit the existence of highly domain specific modules, and, suggest that the neural anatomy of the brain supports a model based on more domain general faculties and processes.

When did the chimpanzee–human last common ancestor diverge?,Estimates of the divergence date vary widely from thirteen to five million years ago,". The chimpanzee–human divergence likely took place around 10 to 7 million years ago. The list of fossils begins with Graecopithecus, dated some 7.2 million years ago, which may or may not still be ancestral to both the human and the chimpanzee lineage. For the earlier history of the human lineage, see Timeline of human evolution#Hominidae, Hominidae#Phylogeny

. --- # Chimpanzee–human last common ancestor The chimpanzee–human last common ancestor (CHLCA) is the last common ancestor shared by the extant Homo (human) and Pan (chimpanzee and bonobo) genera of Hominini. Estimates of the divergence date vary widely from thirteen to five million years ago

. An estimate of 10 to 13 million years for the CHLCA was proposed in 1998, and a range of 7 to 10 million years ago is assumed by White and colleagues in 2009. A 2016 study analyzed transitions at CpG sites in genome sequences, which exhibit a more clocklike behavior than other substitutions, arriving at an estimate for human and chimpanzee divergence time of 12.1 million years.

What is the purpose of using chimpanzees as an outgroup in human genetic studies?,As a reference point for calculating single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rates in human populations,". In human genetic studies, the CHLCA is useful as an anchor point for calculating single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rates in human populations where chimpanzees are used as an outgroup, that is, as the extant species most genetically similar to Homo sapiens. Despite extensive research, no direct fossil evidence of the CHLCA has been discovered

. Comparing a given gene with that of other species enables geneticists to determine whether it is rapidly evolving in humans alone. For example, while human DNA is on average 98% identical to chimp DNA, the so-called Human Accelerated Region 1 (HAR1), involved in the development of the brain, is only 85% similar

. Furthermore, analysis of the two species' genes in 2006 provides evidence that after human ancestors had started to diverge from chimpanzees, interspecies mating between ""proto-human"" and ""proto-chimpanzees"" nonetheless occurred regularly enough to change certain genes in the new gene pool: In the 1990s, several teams of paleoanthropologists were working throughout Africa looking for evidence of the earliest divergence of the hominin lineage from the great apes

. Although most hominin fossils from Africa have been found in eastern and southern Africa, there are a few exceptions. One is Sahelanthropus tchadensis, discovered in the central African country of Chad in 2002.

This split is also referenced as the ""orangutan–human last common ancestor"" by Jeffrey H. Schwartz, professor of anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Arts and Sciences, and John Grehan, director of science at the Buffalo Museum

. Hominidae has two subfamilies, Ponginae (orangutans) and Homininae (African apes, including the human lineage). A 2014 whole-genome molecular dating analysis indicated that the gibbon lineage diverged from that of great apes (Hominidae) around 17 million years ago (16.8±0.9 Mya), based on certain assumptions about the generation time and mutation rate. The extinct Bunopithecus sericus was a gibbon or gibbon-like ape

When did hominoidea (apes) evolve in Africa?,About 18 million years ago,". Hominoidea (commonly known as apes) are thought to have evolved in Africa by about 18 million years ago. Among the genera thought to be in the ape lineage leading up to the emergence of the great apes (Hominidae) about 13 million years ago are Proconsul, Rangwapithecus, Dendropithecus, Nacholapithecus, Equatorius, Afropithecus and Kenyapithecus, all from East Africa. During the early Miocene, Europe and Africa were connected by land bridges over the Tethys Sea

. Primates produced successive clades leading to the ape superfamily, which gave rise to the hominid and the gibbon families; these diverged some 15–20 mya. African and Asian hominids (including orangutans) diverged about 14 mya. Hominins (including the Australopithecine and Panina subtribes) parted from the Gorillini tribe between 8 and 9 mya; Australopithecine (including the extinct biped ancestors of humans) separated from the Pan genus (containing chimpanzees and bonobos) 4–7 mya

When did great apes first appear in the fossil record in Europe and Asia?,About 12 million years ago,". Apes showed up in Europe in the fossil record beginning 17 million years ago. Great apes show up in the fossil record in Europe and Asia beginning about 12 million years ago. Apart from humans, the only living great ape in Asia is the orangutan. Various genera of dryopithecines have been identified and are classified as an extinct sister clade of the Homininae

When did the climate in Europe start to change?,During the later Miocene,". Modern humans then repopulated Europe from the east after the eruption and the ice age that took place from 38,000 to 36,000 BCE. A mitochondrial DNA sequence of two Cro-Magnons from the Paglicci Cave in Italy, dated to 23,000 and 24,000 years old (Paglicci 52 and 12), identified the mtDNA as Haplogroup N, typical of the latter group. The expansion of modern human population is thought to have begun 45,000 years ago, and it may have taken 15,000–20,000 years for Europe to be colonized

. But about 14,000 years ago, humans from Southeastern Europe, especially Greece and Turkey, began migrating to the rest of the continent, displacing the first group of humans. Analysis of genomic data revealed that all Europeans since 37,000 years ago have descended from a single founding population that survived the Ice Age, with specimens found in various parts of the continent, such as Belgium

What replaced tropical forest in Europe about 9.5 million years ago?,Woodlands,". About 9.5 million years ago, tropical forest in Europe was replaced by woodlands which were less suitable for great apes, and European Homininae (close to the Dryopithecini-Hominini split) appear to have migrated back to Africa where they would have diverged into Gorillini and Hominini. Plant fossils reveal that forests use to once extend ""from southern Europe, through Central Asia, and into China prior to the formation of the Himalayas""

. 38,000 BCE of the super-volcano in the Phlegrean Fields near Naples, which left much of eastern Europe covered in ash, wiped out both the last Neanderthal and the first Homo Sapiens populations of the early Upper Paleolithic. Modern Europeans of today bear no trace of the genomes of the first Homo Sapiens Europeans, but only of those from after the ecological crisis of 38,000 BCE

What is unique about the sweat glands of great apes compared to those of lesser monkeys?,"Great apes have sweat glands in the armpits, whereas lesser monkeys have them in the chest.",". This suggests that the ancestral hominoid once lived throughout a vast area and as the Earth's climate and ecosystems changed, the ancestral hominoids ultimately became geographically isolated from one another. The orangutan–human last common ancestor was tailless and had a broad flat rib cage, a larger body size, larger brain, and in females, the canine teeth had started to shrink like their descendants.: 201 Great apes have sweat glands in the armpits versus in the chest like lesser monkeys

. One notable finding is that nonhuman primates, including the other great apes, produce calls that are graded, as opposed to categorically differentiated, with listeners striving to evaluate subtle gradations in signallers' emotional and bodily states. Nonhuman apes seemingly find it extremely difficult to produce vocalisations in the absence of the corresponding emotional states

What is the estimated time period when the gibbon–human last common ancestor lived?,20 to 16 million years ago,". --- # Gibbon–human last common ancestor The gibbon–human last common ancestor is the last common ancestor of the superfamily Hominoidea (apes), dating to the split of the Hylobatidae (gibbons) and Hominidae (great apes) families. It is dated to the early Miocene, roughly 20 to 16 million years ago. Hylobatidae has four gibbon genera (Hylobates with 9 species, Hoolock with 3 species, Nomascus with 7 species and Symphalangus with only 1 species) containing 20 different species

. According to the Chimpanzee Genome Project, the human–chimpanzee last common ancestor existed about five to six million years ago, assuming a constant rate of mutation. However, hominin species dated to earlier than the date could call this into question. Sahelanthropus tchadensis, commonly called ""Toumai"", is about seven million years old and Orrorin tugenensis lived at least six million years ago

It also lacks contextualization and does not clarify the assumptions used in the estimation.
What is the approximate time period when the four genera within the Hylobatidae lineage began to rapidly radiation?,7 to 5 Mya,". Adaptive divergence associated with chromosomal rearrangements led to rapid radiation of the four genera within the Hylobatidae lineage between about 7 to 5 Mya. Each genus comprises a distinct, well-delineated lineage, but the sequence and timing of divergences among these genera have been hard to resolve due to radiative speciations and extensive incomplete lineage sorting

. Recent coalescent-based analysis of both the coding and noncoding parts of the genome suggests that the most likely sequence of species divergences in the Hylobatidae lineage is (Hylobates, (Nomascus, (Hoolock, Symphalangus))). Though other studies have also found different topology. Because fossils are so scarce, it is not clear what GHLCA looked like. A 2019 study found that the species was ""smaller than previously thought"" and about the size of a gibbon

. The gibbons (family Hylobatidae) and then the orangutans (genus Pongo) were the first groups to split from the line leading to the hominins, including humans—followed by gorillas (genus Gorilla), and, ultimately, by the chimpanzees (genus Pan).

It is unknown whether GHLCA was tailless and had a broad, flat rib cage like their descendants.: 193 But it is likely that it was a small animal, probably weighing only 12 kilograms (26 lb). This contradicts previous theories that they were the size of chimpanzees and that apes moved to hang and to swing from trees to get off the ground because they were too big. There might have been an arms race in brachiating to reach the best food

. --- # Gorilla–human last common ancestor The gorilla–human last common ancestor (GHLCA, GLCA, or G/H LCA) is the last species that the tribes Hominini and Gorillini (i.e. the chimpanzee–human last common ancestor on one hand and gorillas on the other) share as a common ancestor. It is estimated to have lived 8 to 10 million years ago (TGHLCA) during the late Miocene. The fossil find of Nakalipithecus nakayamai are closest in age to the GHLCA

The less pronounced nature of the upper canine teeth in A. ramidus has been used to infer aspects of the social behavior of the species and more ancestral hominids. In particular, it has been used to suggest that the last common ancestor of hominids and African apes was characterized by relatively little aggression between males and between groups

What was the initial purpose of tool use according to David Buss?,Gathering plants,". David Buss argues that tools were not used for hunting initially, but instead to dig up and gather plants. It is possible the invention of tools explains the transition from a forest habitat to the savanna woodlands and grasslands. Tools made gathering food easier and more economical enabling ancestral humans to live in a sparser environment. It was not until the invention of receptacles to store food that more elaborate tools used to hunt, skin, and butcher were developed

. Advocates of the hunting hypothesis tend to believe that tool use and toolmaking essential to effective hunting were an extremely important part of human evolution, and trace the origin of language and religion to a hunting context. As societal evidence David Buss cites that modern tribal population deploy hunting as their primary way of acquiring food. The Aka pygmies in the Central African Republic spend 56% of their quest for nourishment hunting, 27% gathering, and 17% processing food

. The Gathering Hypothesis is the view that men provided critical evolutionary propulsion of the modern human through hunting, whereas women contributed via gathering. In addition, it helps provide for the fact that our anc","According to the context, David Buss argues that tools were initially used for digging up and gathering plants, rather than hunting.",0.7,0.8,0.9,0.6,0.8,"The LLM correctly states that tools were initially used for digging up and gathering plants, but it does not provide any supporting evidence from the context to substantiate this claim."
What was the difference found by McBurney et al. in spatial abilities between women and men?,"Women performed better on memory tasks, while men performed better on rotation tasks.",". It has been found that both male and female personality traits differ on a large spectrum. Males had a higher rate of traits relating to dominance, tension, and directness. Females had higher rates organizational behavior and more emotional based characteristics. Evolutionary psychologists contrast their approach to what they term the ""standard social science model,"" according to which the mind is a general-purpose cognition device shaped almost entirely by culture

. In females, superiority in verbal abilities, higher rule obedience, socialisation, empathy and agreeableness can be presented as a reflection of the systemic conservation function of the female sex. Male superiority is mostly noted in exploratory abilities - in risk- and sensation seeking, spacial orientation, physical strength and higher rates in physical aggression

. In combination with higher birth and accidental death rates this pattern might be a reflection of the systemic variational function (testing the boundaries of beneficial characteristics) of the male sex. As a result, psychological sex differences might be influenced by a global tendency within a species to expand its norm of reaction, but at the same","According to the context, there is no mention of McBurney et al. or any specific study on spatial abilities between women and men.

"According to the context, are female individuals better at gathering plants than males?",true,". Hawkes furthers the argument for the gathering hypothesis in that women obtain larger fitness benefits by tending to their offspring, thus they provision, because it is simpler to coordinate gathering and offspring care. The ""Superior Spatial Memory of Women"" has been supported through more recent studies by Neave et al. in which females were both quicker and made few mistakes in gathering and identifying specific plants than their male counterparts

. In addition, subsistence labor differentiates as observations suggests gender patterns originate from genetic traits. Another possible explanation for women gathering is their inherent prioritization of rearing offspring, which is difficult to uphold if women were hunting. Hunting is seen as more cost effective for men than for women. The division of labor allows both types of resources (animals and plants) to be utilized

. Individual or small group hunting requires patience and skill more than strength, so women are just as capable as men. Plant collecting can be a physically demanding task so strength, endurance, or patience does not explain why women do not regularly hunt large game. Since women hunt while menstruating, and if ","Yes, according to the context, females were found to be both quicker and made few mistakes in gathering and identifying specific plants than their male counterparts (Neave et al.'s study).",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.9,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the context as discussing the hypothesis about the differences in plant gathering abilities between genders.

What aspects of human behavior cannot be explained by the gathering hypothesis?,"Sexual division of labor in men hunting and women gathering, high parental investment of human males, male coalition psychology, and reciprocal alliances (alliance theory)",". However, the gathering hypothesis cannot account for sexual division of labor in men hunting and women gathering, high parental investment of human males, male coalition psychology, why humans live in environments without plant resources, human gut structure versus primate gut structure, reciprocal alliances (alliance theory), and why women share food

A common argument against the Gathering hypothesis is if gathering was the best or most efficient method of acquiring food, then why wouldn’t men just gather and stop wasting their time hunting. The division of labor among men and woman is unaccounted for throughout cultures

. The Gathering Hypothesis is a view that states men provided the evolution of the current human through hunting while women contributed via gathering.

What is unique about human locomotion compared to other animals?,The forces our feet exert on the ground are very markedly two-peaked when we walk fast,". The general form of human locomotion is markedly distinct from all other animals observed in nature. The unique manner of human locomotion has been described in the Journal of Anatomy: ""… no animal walks or runs as we do. We keep the trunk erect; in walking, our knees are almost straight at mid-stance; the forces our feet exert on the ground are very markedly two-peaked when we walk fast; and in walking and usually in running, we strike the ground initially with the heel alone

. A number of groups of extant mammals have independently evolved bipedalism as their main form of locomotion – for example, humans, ground pangolins, the extinct giant ground sloths, numerous species of jumping rodents and macropods. Humans, as their bipedalism has been extensively studied, are documented in the next section. Macropods are believed to have evolved bipedal hopping only once in their evolution, at some time no later than 45 million years ago

What part of the foot do barefoot runners tend to land on?,"The fronts of the foot, specifically the heads of the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones.",". No animal walks or runs like that."" More recent research has shown that so-called heelstrike, the tendency of runners to channel all of their weight through the heel as the leading foot touches the ground, is not universal. This may be an artefact of more comfortable shoes, those specifically designed for running. Runners who have only ever gone barefoot tend to land on the front of the foot, on the heads of the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones

. When asked to run on a forceplace that records the degree of pressure experienced by the foot over the course of a stride barefoot runners display a markedly flatter and less intense force curve, indicating a reduced impact on the bones of their feet. Researchers whose work has elucidated this detail, such as Harvard's Daniel Lieberman, conclude that this was likely the stride of humanity's earliest upright ancestors

Earlier fossils, such as Orrorin tugenensis, indicate bipedalism around six million years ago, around the time of the split between humans and chimpanzees indicated by genetic studies. This suggests that erect, straight-legged walking originated as an adaptation to tree-dwelling. Major changes to the pelvis and feet had already taken place before Australopithecus.

What is the primary argument used by proponents of the evolutionary perspective on human movement?,Natural selection,". Their case rests on the traditional grounds that underlie all arguments from human evolution: namely that millions of years of natural selection have optimized the human body for one mode of locomotion and that modern attempts to surpass this through technological interventions, such as engineered running shoes, cannot compete with human anatomy as delivered by evolution

What is one way that humans efficiently dissipate heat?,through sweating,". This tactic of exhausting prey was especially advantageous for capturing large quadrupedal mammals struggling to thermoregulate in hot weather and over extended distances. Conversely, humans possess efficient means to dissipate heat, primarily through sweating. Specifically, evaporative heat dissipation from the scalp and face prevents hyperthermia and heat-induced encephalitis by extreme cardiovascular loads

. Also, humans had physiological mechanisms that reduced the rate of metabolism and that modified the sensitivity of sweat glands to provide an adequate amount for cooldown without the individual becoming dehydrated. There are two types of heat the body is adapted to, humid heat and dry heat, but the body adapts to both in similar ways

. Dry heat, on the other hand, can cause dehydration, as sweat will tend to evaporate extremely quickly. Individuals with less fat and slightly lower body temperatures can more easily handle both humid and dry heat. When humans are exposed to certain climates for extended periods of time, physiological changes occur to help the individual adapt to hot or cold climates. This helps the body conserve energy

What is suggested by the adaptation of the Homo skull and neck?,Traits selective to endurance running optimization,". Furthermore, as humans continued to develop, their posture became more upright and subsequently increased vertically with the elongation of limbs and torso, effectively increasing surface area for corporeal heat dissipation. In work exploring the evolution of the human head, paleontologist Daniel Lieberman suggests that certain adaptations to the Homo skull and neck are correlational evidence of traits selective to endurance running optimization

. Other significant morphological changes included the evolution of a power and precision grip, a change first occurring in H. erectus. Bipedalism (walking on two legs) is the basic adaptation of the hominid and is considered the main cause behind a suite of skeletal changes shared by all bipedal hominids. The earliest hominin, of presumably primitive bipedalism, is considered to be either Sahelanthropus or Orrorin, both of which arose some 6 to 7 million years ago

. The back set of molars were much larger for this reason also. The dependence on these higher-calorie foods came from the inefficiency of bipedalism and the growing energy costs of climbing tall trees. Human ancestors are thought to have had more muscles connecting the skull","According to the context, the adaptation of the Homo skull and neck are ""correlational evidence of traits selective to endurance running optimization"".",0.7,0.5,0.6,0.8,0.0,The LLM's answer is relevant but lacks specific details about the Homo skull and neck adaptation and its relation to endurance running. It also doesn't provide sufficient context about the overall evolution of the human head and the importance of this adaptation for endurance.
What is one adaptation that promotes improved head balance for cranial stabilization during extended periods of running?,A flattening face,". Specifically, he posits that adaptations such as a flattening face and the development of the nuchal ligament promote improved head balance for cranial stabilization during extended periods of running. Compared to Australopithecus fossil skeletons, selection for walking by itself would not develop some of these proposed ""endurance running"" derived traits: The derived longer hindlimb was already present in Australopithecus along with evidence for foot bones with a stiff arch

Furthermore, as humans continued to develop, their posture became more upright and subsequently increased vertically with the elongation of limbs and torso, effectively increasing surface area for corporeal heat dissipation. In work exploring the evolution of the human head, paleontologist Daniel Lieberman suggests that certain adaptations to the Homo skull and neck are correlational evidence of traits selective to endurance running optimization

. Human runners differ from quadrupeds in that while running they employ several phase-locked patterns (4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 5:2, and 3:2), although a 2:1 coupling ratio appears to be favored. Even though the evolution of bipedal gait has reduced the mechanical cons","According to the context, one adaptation that promotes improved head balance for cranial stabilization during extended periods of running is a flattening face.",1.0,0.8,0.9,0.7,1.0,"The context mentions that a flattening face is one adaptation that promotes improved head balance for cranial stabilization during extended periods of running, but it doesn't specify how the face is flattened or how it relates to cranial stabilization."
What is known about the efficiency of running in Australopithecus?,Running was slower and less efficient than in modern humans.,". Walking and running in Australopithecus may have been the same as early Homo. Research on the former has shown running to be slower and less efficient than in modern humans.

What is the main concern regarding the proposed derived traits?,Their validity,". Among the issues identified is the lack of distinction between what trait developed and how it is used, and the underlying reasons or forces that created the novel trait initially. This is particularly difficult to access in intangible language and cognition. This debate has continued over decades and most often presents in the form of a response and published dialogue between theorists. This continued debate has prompted efforts to marry the two perspectives in a useful way

. The methodology by which the proposed derived traits were chosen and evaluated does not seem to have been stated, and there were immediate highly technical arguments ""dismissing their validity and terming them either trivial or incorrect."" Most of those proposed traits have not been tested for their effect on walking and running efficiency. The new trunk shape counter-rotations, which help control rotations induced by hip-joint motion, seem active during walking

What is the type of energy storage that occurs in the plantar soft tissue of the foot during walking?,Elastic,". Elastic energy storage does occur in the plantar soft tissue of the foot during walking. Relative lower-limb length has a slightly larger effect on the economy of walking than running. The heel-down foot posture makes walking economical but does not benefit running

. Additionally, having longer limbs is more energy-efficient, since longer limbs mean that overall muscle strain is lessened. Better energy efficiency, in turn, means higher endurance, particularly when running long distances. Running is characterized by a spring-mass movement. Kinetic and potential energy are in phase, and the energy is stored & released from a spring-like limb during foot contact, achieved by the plantar arch and the Achilles tendon in the foot and leg, respectively

. When non-human hominids walk upright, weight is transmitted from the heel, along the outside of the foot, and then through the middle toes while a human foot transmits weight from the heel, along the outside of the foot, across the ball of the foot and finally through the big toe. This transference of weight contributes to energy conservation during locomotion. The muscles that work along with the hallux has evolved to provide efficie","According to the context, the type of energy storage that occurs in the plantar soft tissue of the foot during walking is ""Elastic energy storage"".

What is the estimated time it takes for scavengers to reach a carcass after detection?,30 minutes,". Model-based analysis showing that scavengers would reach a carcass within 30 minutes of detection suggests that ""endurance running"" would not have given earlier access to carcasses and so not result in selection for ""endurance running"". Earlier access to carcasses may have been selected for running short distances of 5 km or less, with adaptations that generally improved running performance

. This method is different as compared to other societies where hunters retain the control of their kills and signal their intent of sharing. This alternate method aligns with the coalition support hypothesis, in efforts to create and preserve political associations. The meat from successful large game hunts are more than what a single hunter can consume. Further, hunting success varies by week. One week a hunter may succeed in hunting large game and the next may return with no meat

. Human remains have been dated to 100,000 years ago. Human skeletons were found stained with red ocher. A variety of grave goods were found at the burial site. The mandible of a wild boar was found placed in the arms of one of the skeletons

The earliest hominin, of presumably primitive bipedalism, is considered to be either Sahelanthropus or Orrorin, both of which arose some 6 to 7 million years ago

In humans, walking is composed of several separate processes: Earl","According to the context, the primary function that led to the evolution of hindlimb characteristics in Australopithecus or early Homo was ""walking efficiency"", with improved running as a by-product.",0.8,0.9,0.7,0.6,0.0,The context provides no specific details about the primary function that led to the evolution of hindlimb characteristics in Australopithecus or early Homo. The LLM's answer seems to focus more on walking efficiency rather than hindlimb characteristics.
What type of activities led to substantially higher gluteus maximus activity?,Maximal effort jumping and punching,". Gluteus maximus activity was substantially higher in maximal effort jumping and punching than sprinting, and substantially higher in sprinting than in running at speeds that can be sustained. The activity levels are not consistent with the suggestion that the muscle size is a result of selection for sustained endurance running. Additionally, gluteus maximus activity was much greater in sprinting than in running, similar in climbing and running, and greater in running than walking

. Increased muscle activity seems related to the speed and intensity of the movement rather than the gait itself. The data suggests that the large size of the gluteus maximus reflects multiple roles during rapid and powerful movements rather than a specific adaptation to submaximal endurance running

. Change in the shape of the hip may have led to the decrease in the degree of hip extension, an energy efficient adaptation. The ilium changed from a long and narrow shape to a short and broad one and the walls of the pelvis modernized to face laterally. These combined changes provide increased area for the gluteus muscles to attach; this helps to stabilize the torso while standing on one leg

What is the scientific consensus on the aquatic ape hypothesis?,The scientific consensus is that the aquatic ape hypothesis is generally ignored or classified as pseudoscience by anthropologists.,". --- # Aquatic ape hypothesis The aquatic ape hypothesis (AAH), also referred to as aquatic ape theory (AAT) or the waterside hypothesis of human evolution, postulates that the ancestors of modern humans took a divergent evolutionary pathway from the other great apes by becoming adapted to a more aquatic habitat. While the hypothesis has some popularity with the lay public, it is generally ignored or classified as pseudoscience by anthropologists

. The AAH is generally ignored by anthropologists, although it has a following outside academia and conferences on the topic have received celebrity endorsement, for example from David Attenborough. Despite being debunked, it returns periodically, being promoted as recently as 2019. Academics who have commented on the aquatic ape hypothesis include categorical opponents (generally members of the community of academic anthropology) who reject almost all of the claims related to the hypothesis

In 1967, the hypothesis was mentioned in The Naked Ape, a popular book by the zoologist Desmond Morris, who reduced Hardy's phrase ""more aquatic ape-like ancestors"" to the bare ""aquatic ape"", commenting that ""despite its most appealing indirect ev","According to the context, the scientific consensus is that the aquatic ape hypothesis (AAH) is generally ignored or classified as pseudoscience by anthropologists.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,"The LLM-generated answer completely disagrees with the ground truth answer, providing a misleading and inaccurate summary of the topic."
Who initially proposed the theory about hominin fossils in East Africa?,Alister Hardy,". The theory developed before major discoveries of ancient hominin fossils in East Africa. The hypothesis was initially proposed by the English marine biologist Alister Hardy in 1960, who argued that a branch of apes was forced by competition over terrestrial habitats to hunt for food such as shellfish on the coast and seabed, leading to adaptations that explained distinctive characteristics of modern humans such as functional hairlessness and bipedalism

. Dart realised that the fossil contained a number of humanoid features, and so he came to the conclusion that this was an early human ancestor. Later, Scottish paleontologist Robert Broom and Dart set out to search for more early hominin specimens, and several more A. africanus remains from various sites. Initially, anthropologists were largely hostile to the idea that these discoveries were anything but apes, though this changed during the late 1940s

. During the 1960s and 1970s, hundreds of fossils were found in East Africa in the regions of the Olduvai Gorge and Lake Turkana. These searches were carried out by the Leakey family, with Louis Leakey and his wife Mary Leakey, and later their son Richard and daughter-in-law Meave,","According to the context, Alister Hardy, an English marine biologist, initially proposed the theory about hominin fossils in East Africa in 1960.",0.7,0.8,0.6,0.5,0.0,"The LLM provides a factual summary of the context, but it fails to mention the name of the initial proposer, Alister Hardy."
Who wrote the book 'The Descent of Woman'?,Elaine Morgan,". The popular science writer Elaine Morgan supported this hypothesis in her 1972 book The Descent of Woman. In it, she contrasted the theory with zoologist and ethnologist Desmond Morris's theories of sexuality, which she believed to be rooted in sexism

. As he later said to his ex-pupil Desmond Morris, ""Of course I then had to write an article to refute this saying no this is just a guess, a rough hypothesis, this isn't a proven fact. And of course we're not related to dolphins."" Elaine Morgan's 1972 book Descent of Woman became an international best-seller, a Book of the Month selection in the United States and was translated into ten languages

. When it aroused no reaction in the academic community, she dropped the feminist criticism and wrote a series of books–The Aquatic Ape (1982), The Scars of Evolution (1990), The Descent of the Child (1994), The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis (1997) and The Naked Darwinist (2008)–which explored the issues in more detail.

Is the hypothesis that anthropologists do not take seriously an 'umbrella hypothesis'?,True,". Anthropologists do not take the hypothesis seriously: John Langdon characterized it as an ""umbrella hypothesis"" (a hypothesis that tries to explain many separate traits of humans as a result of a single adaptive pressure) that was not consistent with the fossil record, and said that its claim that it was simpler and therefore more likely to be true than traditional explanations of human evolution was not true

. Langdon argued that however popular the idea was with the public, the ""umbrella"" nature of the idea means that it cannot serve as a proper scientific hypothesis. Langdon also objected to Morgan's blanket opposition to the ""savannah hypothesis"" which he took to be the ""collective discipline of paleoanthropology"". He observed that some anthropologists had regarded the idea as not worth the trouble of a rebuttal

. In a 1997 critique, anthropologist John Langdon considered the AAH under the heading of an ""umbrella hypothesis"" and argued that the difficulty of ever disproving such a thing meant that although the idea has the appearance of being a parsimonious explanation, it actually was no more powerful an explanation than the null hypothesis that human evolution is not part","According to the context, yes, the hypothesis that anthropologists do not take seriously is indeed referred to as an ""umbrella hypothesis"" by John Langdon.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"{

Even many of Darwin's original supporters (such as Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Lyell) balked at the idea that human beings could have evolved their apparently boundless mental capacities and moral sensibilities through natural selection. Prior to the general acceptance of Africa as the root of genus Homo, 19th-century naturalists sought the origin of humans in Asia

. Huxley convincingly illustrated many of the similarities and differences between humans and apes in his 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. By the time Darwin published his own book on the subject, Descent of Man, it was already a well-known interpretation of his theory—and the interpretation which made the theory highly controversial

When did Alfred Hardy voice his hypothesis publicly?,5 March 1960,". On the advice of his colleagues, Hardy delayed presenting the hypothesis for approximately thirty years. After he had become a respected academic and knighted for contributions to marine biology, Hardy finally voiced his thoughts in a speech to the British Sub-Aqua Club in Brighton on 5 March 1960

. Tobias and his student further criticised the orthodox hypothesis by arguing that the coming out of the forest of man's precursors had been an unexamined assumption of evolution since the days of Lamarck, and followed by Darwin, Wallace and Haeckel, well before Raymond Dart used it. Alister Hardy was astonished and mortified in 1960 when the national Sunday papers carried banner headlines ""Oxford professor says man a sea ape"", causing problems with his Oxford colleagues

. This idea, labelled ""the wading hypothesis"", was originally suggested by the Oxford marine biologist Alister Hardy who said: ""It seems to me likely that Man learnt to stand erect first in water and then, as his balance improved, he found he became better equipped for standing up on the shore when he came out, and indeed also for running

Who showed significant interest in the subject matter?,Carl Sauer,". Some interest was received, notably from the geographer Carl Sauer whose views on the role of the seashore in human evolution ""stimulated tremendous progress in the study of coastal and aquatic adaptations"" inside marine archaeology

. While Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection had provoked a surge of speculation on the origin of language over a century and a half ago, the speculations had not resulted in a scientific consensus by 1996. Despite this, academic interest had returned to the topic by the early 1990s. Linguists, archaeologists, psychologists, and anthropologists have renewed the investigation into the origin of language with modern methods

What was the focus of Robert Ardrey's 1961 best-seller 'African Genesis'?,Hunting,". While traditional descriptions of 'savage' existence identified three common sources of sustenance: gathering of fruit and nuts, fishing, and hunting, in the 1950s, the anthropologist Raymond Dart focused on hunting and gathering as the likely organizing concept of human society in prehistory, and hunting was the focus of the screenwriter Robert Ardrey's 1961 best-seller African Genesis

What drove a branch of primitive apes to start feeding on sea-shores and hunting for seafood?,Competition from life in the trees,". My thesis is that a branch of this primitive ape-stock was forced by competition from life in the trees to feed on the sea-shores and to hunt for food, shell fish, sea-urchins etc., in the shallow waters off the coast.

Do captive apes have levels of subcutaneous fat similar to humans?,Yes,". He pointed to humans' lack of body hair as being analogous to the same lack seen in whales and hippopotamuses, and noted the layer of subcutaneous fat humans have that Hardy believed other apes lacked, although it has been shown that captive apes with ample access to food have levels of subcutaneous fat similar to humans

. In contrast, gorillas living in harems exhibit a much stronger sexual dimorphism (see: homininae). The theory of sexual selection has been used to explain a number of human anatomical features. These include rounded breasts, facial hair, pubic hair and penis size. The breasts of primates are flat, yet are able to produce sufficient milk for feeding their young. The breasts of non-lactating human females are filled with fatty tissue and not milk

. Greater overall body fat percentage in human females appears to be unique among primates and may function in storing resources needed to gestate and support large-brained offspring as well as in sexual selection.

His summary at the end was: Overall, it will be clear that I do not think it would be correct to designate our early hominid ancestors as 'aquatic'. But at the same time there does seem to be evidence that not only did they take to water from time to time but that the water (and by this I mean inland lakes and rivers) was a habitat that provided enough extra food to count as an agency for selection

The passage suggests that there is no conclusive evidence to support the idea that some traits attributed to aquatic adaptation are actually similar to those observed in early hominids.
What is the typical age range for human babies exhibiting a swimming response?,up to 6 months old,". It also exists as a lesser response in other animals, including human babies up to 6 months old (see infant swimming). However adult humans generally exhibit a mild response. Hardy additionally posited that bipedalism evolved first as an aid to wading before becoming the usual means of human locomotion, and tool use evolved out of the use of rocks to crack open shellfish. These last arguments were cited by later proponents of AAH as an inspiration for their research programs

. The smaller birth canal became a limiting factor to brain size increases in early humans and prompted a shorter gestation period leading to the relative immaturity of human offspring, who are unable to walk much before 12 months and have greater neoteny, compared to other primates, who are mobile at a much earlier age

What was the location where a conference on the Hardy and Morgan hypothesis was held in 1987?,"Valkenburg, Netherlands",". Other academics have argued that the rejection of Hardy and Morgan is partially unfair given that other explanations which suffer from similar problems are not so strongly opposed. A conference devoted to the subject was held at Valkenburg, Netherlands, in 1987. Its 22 participants included academic proponents and opponents of the hypothesis and several neutral observers headed by the anthropologist Vernon Reynolds of the University of Oxford

What type of water did the early hominid ancestors possibly use as a habitat?,Inland lakes and rivers,". His summary at the end was: Overall, it will be clear that I do not think it would be correct to designate our early hominid ancestors as 'aquatic'. But at the same time there does seem to be evidence that not only did they take to water from time to time but that the water (and by this I mean inland lakes and rivers) was a habitat that provided enough extra food to count as an agency for selection

. One controversial suggestion is that certain pre-adaptations for spoken language evolved during a time when ancestral hominins lived close to river banks and lake shores rich in fatty acids and other brain-specific nutrients. Occasional wading or swimming may also have led to enhanced breath-control (breath-hold diving)

. Evidence supports aquatic food consumption in Homo as early as the Pliocene, but its linkage to brain evolution remains controversial. Further, there is no evidence that humans ate fish in significant amounts earlier than tens to hundreds of thousands of years ago.

What is the name of the anthropologist who considered the AAH (Assumption About Human Evolution) under the heading of an 'umbrella hypothesis' in 1997?,John Langdon,". In a 1997 critique, anthropologist John Langdon considered the AAH under the heading of an ""umbrella hypothesis"" and argued that the difficulty of ever disproving such a thing meant that although the idea has the appearance of being a parsimonious explanation, it actually was no more powerful an explanation than the null hypothesis that human evolution is not particularly guided by interaction with bodies of water

. According to anthropologist John Hawkes, the AAH is not consistent with the fossil record. Traits that the hypothesis tries to explain evolved at vastly different times, and distributions of soft tissue the hypothesis alleges are unique to humans are common among other primates. In 1942 the German pathologist Max Westenhöfer (1871–1957) discussed various human characteristics (hairlessness, subcutaneous fat, the regression of the olfactory organ, webbed fingers, direction of the body hair etc

What was Langdon's criticism regarding the 'savannah hypothesis' in paleoanthropology?,It cannot serve as a proper scientific hypothesis due to its 'umbrella' nature,". Langdon argued that however popular the idea was with the public, the ""umbrella"" nature of the idea means that it cannot serve as a proper scientific hypothesis. Langdon also objected to Morgan's blanket opposition to the ""savannah hypothesis"" which he took to be the ""collective discipline of paleoanthropology"". He observed that some anthropologists had regarded the idea as not worth the trouble of a rebuttal

. Anthropologists do not take the hypothesis seriously: John Langdon characterized it as an ""umbrella hypothesis"" (a hypothesis that tries to explain many separate traits of humans as a result of a single adaptive pressure) that was not consistent with the fossil record, and said that its claim that it was simpler and therefore more likely to be true than traditional explanations of human evolution was not true

In 1995, paleoanthropologist Phillip Tobias declared that the savannah hypothesis was dead, because the open conditions did not exist when humanity's precursors stood upright and that therefore the conclusions of the Valkenburg conference were no longer valid.

What is the primary focus of the evidence cited by AAH proponents?,Soft tissue anatomy and physiology,". In addition, the evidence cited by AAH proponents mostly concerned developments in soft tissue anatomy and physiology, whilst paleoanthropologists rarely speculated on evolutionary development of anatomy beyond the musculoskeletal system and brain size as revealed in fossils.

What do Hardy and Morgan incorrectly place in a period of the fossil record?,The alleged aquatic period of human nature,". Hardy and Morgan situated the alleged aquatic period of human nature in a period of the fossil record that is now known not to contain any aquatic ancestors. The traits the AAH tries to explain actually evolved at wildly different time periods. The AAH claims that the alleged aquatic nature of humanity is responsible for human patterns of hair, fat, and sweat, but actually all of these things are similar in humans to other primates

. In their seminal 1967 paper in Science, Sarich and Wilson estimated the divergence time of humans and apes as four to five million years ago, at a time when standard interpretations of the fossil record gave this divergence as at least 10 to as much as 30 million years. Subsequent fossil discoveries, notably ""Lucy"", and reinterpretation of older fossil materials, notably Ramapithecus, showed the younger estimates to be correct and validated the albumin method

Palaeontologist Riley Black concurred with the pseudoscience label, and described the AAH as a ""classic case of picking evidence that fits a preconceived conclusion and ignoring everything else""

. Evidence of a rich cognitive life in primate relatives of humans is extensive, and a wide range of specific behaviours in line with Darwinian theory is well documented.

Is it easy to identify features of modern humans and infer their adaptive value in the past?,No,". However, even if the original value of α is accurate for a particular time period, this extrapolation is still invalid. This is because there has been a large acceleration in the amount of positive selection in the human lineage over the last 40,000 years, in terms of the number of genes that have undergone adaptive evolution (Hawks et al. 2007)

. However, there have also been cautions against the application of this aspect to group ranking during it inappropriate as a measure of evolutionary achievement.

To support these claims, he points to things like the bi-directionality in language usage and comprehension. This is a counter to the claims by theorists like Noam Chomsky, who argued against language as a human specific adaptation. Adaptation and adaptive theory has been argued even separate from its utility in the study of language. Gould and Lewontin engage with what they saw as flaws in adaptive theory using the analogy of the spandrels of San Marco

. Tecumseh Fitch, following Stephen J. Gould, argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptation. He criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptionist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether ""Language has evolved as an adaptation"" as being misleading

When did Elaine Morgan's book 'Descent of Woman' become an international best-seller?,1972,". The popular science writer Elaine Morgan supported this hypothesis in her 1972 book The Descent of Woman. In it, she contrasted the theory with zoologist and ethnologist Desmond Morris's theories of sexuality, which she believed to be rooted in sexism

. As he later said to his ex-pupil Desmond Morris, ""Of course I then had to write an article to refute this saying no this is just a guess, a rough hypothesis, this isn't a proven fact.

What was the outcome of publishing 'The Aquatic Ape' 10 years after its initial version?,It did not garner any more positive reaction from scientists.,". When it aroused no reaction in the academic community, she dropped the feminist criticism and wrote a series of books–The Aquatic Ape (1982), The Scars of Evolution (1990), The Descent of the Child (1994), The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis (1997) and The Naked Darwinist (2008)–which explored the issues in more detail. Books published on the topic since then have avoided the contentious term aquatic and used waterside instead

. The book was praised for its feminism but paleoanthropologists were disappointed with its promotions of the AAH. Morgan removed the feminist critique and left her AAH ideas intact, publishing the book as The Aquatic Ape 10 years later, but it did not garner any more positive reaction from scientists. AAH proponent Algis Kuliukas, performed experiments to measure the comparative energy used when lacking orthograde posture with using fully upright posture

. In 1967, the hypothesis was mentioned in The Naked Ape, a popular book by the zoologist Desmond Morris, who reduced Hardy's phrase ""more aquatic ape-like ancestors"" to the bare ""aquatic ape"", commenting that ""despite its most appealing indirect evidence, the aquatic theory lacks solid support""

For how many years have early humans been bipedal?,5 million,". The evolution of human bipedalism began in primates about four million years ago, or as early as seven million years ago with Sahelanthropus or about 12 million years ago with Danuvius guggenmosi. One hypothesis for human bipedalism is that it evolved as a result of differentially successful survival from carrying food to share with group members, although there are alternative hypotheses. Injured chimpanzees and bonobos have been capable of sustained bipedalism

. --- # Human skeletal changes due to bipedalism The evolution of human bipedalism, which began in primates approximately four million years ago, or as early as seven million years ago with Sahelanthropus, or approximately twelve million years ago with Danuvius guggenmosi, has led to morphological alterations to the human skeleton including changes to the arrangement, shape, and size of the bones of the foot, hip, knee, leg, and the vertebral column

When did humans start consuming fish in significant amounts?,tens to hundreds of thousands of years ago,". Evidence supports aquatic food consumption in Homo as early as the Pliocene, but its linkage to brain evolution remains controversial. Further, there is no evidence that humans ate fish in significant amounts earlier than tens to hundreds of thousands of years ago. Supporters argue that the avoidance of taphonomic bias is the problem, as most hominin fossils occur in lake-side environments, and the presence of fish remains is therefore not proof of fish consumption

. Shell middens 125,000 years old have been found in Eritrea, indicating that the diet of early humans included seafood obtained by beachcombing. The dating of the Southern Dispersal is a matter of dispute. It may have happened either pre- or post-Toba, a catastrophic volcanic eruption that took place between 69,000 and 77,000 years ago at the site of present-day Lake Toba in Sumatra, Indonesia

They also claim that the archaeological record of human fishing and coastal settlement is fundamentally deficient due to postglacial sea level rise. In their 1989 book The Driving Force: Food, Evolution and The Future, Michael Crawford and David Marsh claimed that omega-3 fatty acids were vital for the development of the brain: A branch of the line of primitive ancestral apes was forced by competition to leave the trees and feed on the seashore

. Evolutionary geneticist Stephen Stearns and his colleagues reported signs that women were gradually becoming shorter and heavier. Stearns argued that human culture and changes humans have made on their natural environments are driving human evolution rather than putting the process to a halt. The data indicates that the women were not eating more; rather, the ones who were heavier tended to have more children

. While traditional descriptions of 'savage' existence identified three common sources of sustenance: gathering of fruit and nuts, fishing, and hunting, in the 1950s, the anthropologist Raymond Dart focused on hunting and gathering as the likely organizing concept of human society in prehistory, and hunting was the focus of the sc","According to the context, the book ""The Driving Force: Food, Evolution and The Future"" was written by Michael Crawford and David Marsh.",0.8,0.6,0.9,0.7,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the authors of the book as Michael Crawford and David Marsh, but it provides incorrect information about the book's title."

. The study found that there was a distinction necessary between growth time and growth rate. The times of growth were strikingly similar, but the rates were not. The paper further advocates the use of fossils to assess brain size in general and in relation to cranial capacity. Utilization of endocranial volume as a measure for brain size has been a popular methodology with the fossil record since Darwin in the mid 1800s

What is sexual selection defined as?,a biological way one sex chooses a mate for the best reproductive success,". Sexual selection is a biological way one sex chooses a mate for the best reproductive success. Most compete with others of the same sex for the best mate to contribute their genome for future generations. This has shaped human evolution for many years, but reasons why humans choose their mates are not fully understood. Sexual selection is quite different in non-human animals than humans as they feel more of the evolutionary pressures to reproduce and can easily reject a mate

. Sexual selection is in essence a process which favors sexual displays for attraction, aggressiveness, dominance, size, and strength, and the ability to exclude competitors by force if necessary, or by using resources to win. Both male and female use voice, face, and other physical characteristics to assess a potential mate's ability to reproduce, as well as their health

What percentage of a human's energy and oxygen consumption is taken up by brain maintenance?,A fifth to a quarter,". Some hypotheses about the evolution of the human brain argue that it is a sexually selected trait, as it would not confer enough fitness in itself relative to its high maintenance costs (a fifth to a quarter of the energy and oxygen consumed by a human)

. Paleontology has yet to explain the expansion of this organ over millions of years despite being extremely demanding in terms of energy consumption. The brain of a modern human consumes, on average, about 13 watts (260 kilocalories per day), a fifth of the body's resting power consumption.

Women hunt when it is compatible with children, and this usually means communal net hunts and/or hunting small game, and if childcare prevents a woman from hunting when young, the expertise to be an effective hunter later on may not be acquired.

"According to Charles Darwin, what drove the loss of fur in humans?",sexual selection,"."" Charles Darwin conjectured that the male beard, as well as the hairlessness of humans compared to nearly all other mammals, were results of sexual selection. He reasoned that since the bodies of females are more nearly hairless, the loss of fur was due to sexual selection of females at a remote prehistoric time when males had overwhelming selective power, and that it nonetheless affected males due to genetic correlation between the sexes

. The mismatch timing between biological puberty and age of social maturity in western society has a psychological expectation on children. With puberty, men are generally hairier than women, and Darwin was of the opinion that hairlessness was related to sexual selection; however, several other explanations have been advanced to explain human hairlessness; a leading one being that loss of body hair facilitated sweating

. In The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, Darwin viewed many physical traits which vary around the world as being so trivial to survival that he concluded some input from sexual selection was required to account for their presence

Long-term regional continuity in certain morphological traits is explained by Alan Thorne's ""centre and edge"" population genetics model which resolves Weidenreich's paradox of ""how did populations retain geographical distinctions and y","According to the context, Gonder believed that contrasts in sexual selection acting along with natural selection were significant factors in geographical differentiation in human appearance.",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.7,1.0,The LLM correctly identifies that contrasts in sexual selection acting along with natural selection were a significant factor in geographical differentiation in human appearance. The answer also provides the correct terminology (sexual selection and natural selection) and is consistent with the context.
What did Charles Darwin conclude about physical traits varying around the world?,That they were too trivial to survival and required input from sexual selection,". In The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, Darwin viewed many physical traits which vary around the world as being so trivial to survival that he concluded some input from sexual selection was required to account for their presence

. He noted that variation in these features among the various peoples of the world meant human mate-choice criteria would also have to be quite different if the focus was similar, and he himself doubted that, citing reports indicating that ideals of beauty did not, in fact, vary in this way around the world. The effects on the human brain formation during puberty is directly linked to hormones changes

."" Charles Darwin conjectured that the male beard, as well as the hairlessness of humans compared to nearly all other mammals, were results of sexual selection. He reasoned that since the bodies of females are more nearly hairless, the loss of fur was due to sexual selection of females at a remote prehistoric time when males had overwhelming selective power, and that it nonetheless affected males due to genetic correlation between the sexes

He also hypothesized that contrasts in sexual selection acting along with natural selection were ","According to the context, Charles Darwin concluded that some input from sexual selection was required to account for the presence of these physical traits, as they seemed trivial to survival.",1.0,1.0,0.95,0.7,0.0,The LLM correctly states that Darwin concluded that some input from sexual selection was required to account for the presence of these physical traits.
Do human mate-choice criteria change depending on the people of the world?,No,". He noted that variation in these features among the various peoples of the world meant human mate-choice criteria would also have to be quite different if the focus was similar, and he himself doubted that, citing reports indicating that ideals of beauty did not, in fact, vary in this way around the world. The effects on the human brain formation during puberty is directly linked to hormones changes

. Further research also backs up the idea of using phenotypic traits as a means of assessing a potential mate's fitness for reproduction as well as assessing whether a partner has high genetic quality. One study proposed a link between Human Development Index levels and female preference for male facial appearance. While women from the United Kingdom preferred the faces of men with low cortisol levels, women from Latvia did not discriminate between men with either high or low levels of cortisol

. These putative preferences are predicted to be especially apparent for short-term mating domains because a potential male mate would only be offering genes to a potential offspring. This hypothesis allows researchers to examine whether women select mates who have characteristics that indica","According to the context, the answer is ""no"".

What is one explanation for why humans are generally hairless compared to men?,loss of body hair facilitated sweating,". The mismatch timing between biological puberty and age of social maturity in western society has a psychological expectation on children. With puberty, men are generally hairier than women, and Darwin was of the opinion that hairlessness was related to sexual selection; however, several other explanations have been advanced to explain human hairlessness; a leading one being that loss of body hair facilitated sweating

What is suggested to have decreased over the course of human evolution?,Sexual dimorphism,". A number of other changes have also characterized the evolution of humans, among them an increased reliance on vision rather than smell (highly reduced olfactory bulb); a longer juvenile developmental period and higher infant dependency; a smaller gut and small, misaligned teeth; faster basal metabolism; loss of body hair; an increase in eccrine sweat gland density that is ten times higher than any other catarrhinian primates, yet humans use 30% to 50% less water per day compared to chimps and

. The reduced degree of sexual dimorphism in humans is visible primarily in the reduction of the male canine tooth relative to other ape species (except gibbons) and reduced brow ridges and general robustness of males. Another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of hidden estrus

. Other reported trends appear to include lengthening of the human reproductive period and reduction in cholesterol levels, blood glucose and blood pressure in some populations. Population geneticist Emmanuel Milot and his team studied recent human evolution in an isolated Canadian island using 140 years of church records. They found that selection favored younger age at","According to the context, body hair and robustness (in males) are suggested to have decreased over the course of human evolution.",0.8,0.9,0.7,0.8,0.9,"The answer is somewhat relevant, but it does not accurately reflect the factual information provided in the context. The context suggests that body hair and robustness may have increased or decreased, but the LLM's answer does not provide specific details or provide any supporting evidence to substantiate this claim."
What is the characteristic of breasts in non-lactating human females?,They are filled with fatty tissue and not milk,". In contrast, gorillas living in harems exhibit a much stronger sexual dimorphism (see: homininae). The theory of sexual selection has been used to explain a number of human anatomical features. These include rounded breasts, facial hair, pubic hair and penis size. The breasts of primates are flat, yet are able to produce sufficient milk for feeding their young. The breasts of non-lactating human females are filled with fatty tissue and not milk

. Deposition of fat on the hips, buttocks, and breasts in human females may also be an outcome of female sexual selection, signaling the ability to support gestation and lactation for offspring in environments where resources may be low. However, in the Western World, women with larger breasts are seen as more likely to commit infidelity and more likely to participate in intra-sexual competition with other females

. In addition, this model is supported by a number of modern human traits associated with concealed ovulation (permanently enlarged breasts, lack of sexual swelling) and low sperm competition (moderate sized testes, low sperm mid-piece volume) that argues against recent adaptation to a polygynous reproductive system. However, t","According to the context, the characteristic of breasts in non-lactating human females is that they are filled with fatty tissue and not milk.",1.0,1.0,0.95,0.8,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies that the characteristic of breasts in non-lactating human females is that they are filled with fatty tissue and not milk, but the context does not provide any information about the specific characteristics of breasts in non-lactating human females, which makes it less relevant."
What is the reason behind the loss of the penis bone in humans?,Sexual selection by females looking for a clear sign of good health in prospective mates,". Thus it has been suggested the rounded female breasts are signals of fertility. Richard Dawkins has speculated that the loss of the penis bone in humans, when it is present in other primates, may be due to sexual selection by females looking for a clear sign of good health in prospective mates. Since a human erection relies on a hydraulic pumping system, erection failure is a sensitive early warning of certain kinds of physical and mental ill health

It has been suggested the evolution of the human penis towards larger size was the result of female choice rather than sperm competition, which generally favors large testicles. However, penis size may have been subject to natural selection, rather than sexual selection, due to a larger penis' efficiency in displacing the sperm of rival males during sexual intercourse

What can affect the process of mate selection?,Social and psychosocial factors,". Some of the factors that affect how females select their potential mates for reproduction include voice pitch, facial shape, muscular appearance, and particularly height; with the possibility of a Fisherian runaway in the making. Several studies suggest that there is a link between hormone levels and partner selection among humans

. This process can be affected, however, by social factors, including in cultures where arranged marriage is practiced, or psychosocial factors, such as valuing certain cultural traits of a mate, including a person's social status, or what is perceived to be an ideal partner in various cultures

. It was concluded that societal-level ecological factors impact the valuation of traits by combinations of sex- and stress-hormones. A 2020 study reported that women tend to find a man more attractive if the man's previous relationships ended mutually, and less attractive if the man was dumped.

In which phase of the menstrual cycle do women have a stronger preference for masculine characteristics?,the fertile phase,". In a study measuring female attraction to males with varying levels of masculinity, it was established that women had a general masculinity preference for men's voices, and that the preference for masculinity was greater in the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle than in the non-fertile phase

What is one of the factors that sexual selection favors?,Size,". Sexual selection is in essence a process which favors sexual displays for attraction, aggressiveness, dominance, size, and strength, and the ability to exclude competitors by force if necessary, or by using resources to win. Both male and female use voice, face, and other physical characteristics to assess a potential mate's ability to reproduce, as well as their health

. Sexual selection is a biological way one sex chooses a mate for the best reproductive success. Most compete with others of the same sex for the best mate to contribute their genome for future generations. This has shaped human evolution for many years, but reasons why humans choose their mates are not fully understood. Sexual selection is quite different in non-human animals than humans as they feel more of the evolutionary pressures to reproduce and can easily reject a mate

. Some of the factors that affect how females select their potential mates for reproduction include voice pitch, facial shape, muscular appearance, and particularly height; with the possibility of a Fisherian runaway in the making. Several studies suggest that there is a link between hormone levels and partner selection among humans

However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific examples or elaborating on the importance of other factors such as aggression or dominance."
What characteristic does male contest competition favor in humans?,Large body size,". The latter form competition may be supported by males tending to contribute more to a group task when competing against other groups and to discriminate more strongly against outgroup members. Traits that evolve during contest competition, such as large body size and physical aggression, are often costly to produce and maintain. These traits may therefore be indicators of male genetic quality and/or ability to provide resources and other direct benefits

. Together with visual and chemical signals, these crucial characteristics which are likely to enhance the ability to produce offspring, as well as long-term survival prospects, can be assessed and selections made. Contest competition is form of sexual selection in which mating is obtained by using force or the threat of force to exclude same-sex competitors from mates. Male contest competition favors large body size, which is seen in the sexual dimorphism of human males and females

. A higher pain tolerance allows for males to remain aggressive during contests along with an increased aerobic capacity. Males have an oxygen capacity rate that is 25–30% higher than females. This aerobic capacity increases during puberty when males","According to the context, male contest competition favors large body size in humans, which is seen in the sexual dimorphism of human males and females.",0.75,0.85,0.95,0.65,0.0,"The LLM's answer is somewhat relevant, but it does not capture the nuance of the term 'large body size' and the sexual dimorphism of human males and females. Additionally, it does not provide any context or explanation for its answer."
What percentage of overall muscle mass do human males have compared to females?,61%,". In all living hominid species, males are more muscular, allowing them to have more strength and power. Human males have 61% more overall muscle mass compared to females. This greater muscle mass allows males to gain greater acceleration, speed, and more powerful striking movements. Compared to females, human males exhibit more same-sex aggression, which peaks in young adulthood

. Compared to our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos, Homo sapiens' skeletal muscle is on average about 1.35 to 1.5 times weaker when normalized for size. As little biomechanical difference was found between individual muscle fibers from the different species, this strength difference is likely the result of different muscle fiber type composition. Humans' limb muscles tend to be more biased toward fatigue-resistant, slow twitch Type I muscle fibers

. Greater overall body fat percentage in human females appears to be unique among primates and may function in storing resources needed to gestate and support large-brained offspring as well as in sexual selection. For example, higher female body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased fertility in young women, particularly those in subsi","According to the context, human males have 61% more overall muscle mass compared to females.",1.0,0.8,0.7,0.6,0.9,"The LLM generated answer is mostly correct, but it could be improved by providing more context about the difference in muscle mass between males and females."
In what type of primate species do male fundamental frequencies tend to be lower relative to females?,polygynous anthropoid primates,". Male contest competition also often favors threat displays, which allow one competitor to submit without a costly fight. Low vocalization fundamental frequencies (perceived as vocal pitch) increase the perception of threat among human males. Controlling for body size, lower male fundamental frequency relative to females tends to evolve in polygynous anthropoid primates, where males compete more intensely for mates

. Chimpanzees and humans have the greatest sexual dimorphism in fundamental frequency of all hominids. Males are also more likely to engage in physical risks in front of competitors, and males who take more physical risks are perceived as being stronger. Status badges such as facial hair are generally related to men being perceived as more dominant. Facial hair makes the jaw appear more prominent and shows emotions like anger clearly which makes a male appear more threatening

. Femininity in the female face and voice provide cues to female reproductive hormones and reproductive potential. Males tend to have lower pitched voices than females, likely due to male intrasexual competition, but some evidence suggests that high female voice pitch may also be favored by male ","Based on the context, it can be inferred that in polygynous anthropoid primates, where males compete more intensely for mates, controlling for body size, lower male fundamental frequency relative to females tends to evolve.",0.75,0.85,0.9,0.6,0.8,"The LLM correctly identifies that in polygynous anthropoid primates, males tend to have lower fundamental frequencies relative to females. However, the explanation could be improved by providing more specific examples or references to support the conclusion."
What is true about males engaging in physical risks?,Males who take more physical risks are perceived as being stronger.,". A higher pain tolerance allows for males to remain aggressive during contests along with an increased aerobic capacity. Males have an oxygen capacity rate that is 25–30% higher than females. This aerobic capacity increases during puberty when males are sexually maturing and preparing to mate. Human males engage in both within-group contest competition and coalitional aggression

. Males of low status may be especially vulnerable to being childless. It may have been evolutionary advantageous to engage in highly risky and violently aggressive behavior to increase their status and therefore reproductive success. This may explain why males are generally involved in more crimes, and why low status and being unmarried are associated with criminality

. In combination with higher birth and accidental death rates this pattern might be a reflection of the systemic variational function (testing the boundaries of beneficial characteristics) of the male sex. As a result, psychological sex differences might be influenced by a global tendency within a species to expand its norm of reaction, but at the same time to preserve the beneficial properties of the species

. Chimpanzees and humans have","According to the context, it is true that:

""Low status males may be especially vulnerable to being childless... This may explain why males are generally involved in more crimes...""

This suggests that low-status males may engage in highly risky and violently aggressive behavior to increase their status and reproductive success.",0.8,0.9,0.7,0.8,0.0,"The LLM provides a relevant answer that partially supports the ground truth, but the relevance could be improved by providing a more direct connection between the two concepts."
What is one reason why hominids may have reduced canine size?,Bipedalism and adaptations of the hand,". This model is supported by the reduction (""feminization"") of the male canine teeth in early hominids such as Sahelanthropus tchadensis and Ardipithecus ramidus, which along with low body size dimorphism in Ardipithecus and Australopithecus, suggests a reduction in inter-male antagonistic behavior in early hominids

. Dominance has been associated with increased male mating success. Often contest competition produces anatomical weapons such as antlers or large canine teeth; however, hominids lack canine weaponry typical of other primates. Reduced canine size may be due to bipedalism and adaptations of the hand. Bipedalism is not a common trait, yet many species like the great apes stand on their hind legs when fighting, which increases power behind blows

. However, while both gibbons and hominids have reduced canine sexual dimorphism, female gibbons enlarge ('masculinize') their canines so they can actively share in the defense of their home territory. Instead, the reduction of the male hominid canine is consistent with reduced inter-male aggression in a pair-bonded though group living primate. Recent studies of 4.4 million years old Ardipithecus ramidus suggest bipedalism

. The","One reason why hominids may have reduced canine size is due to adaptations for bipedalism and the development of the hand, which may have led to a reduction in the need for inter-male agonistic behavior.",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.7,1.0,"The LLM provides a valid explanation for the decrease in canine size in hominids, linking it to the reduced need for inter-male antagonistic behavior when using the hand for bipedalism."
What is one adaptation in human hands?,gripping tools or hurling objects like stones,". Hominin hands are adapted for gripping tools or hurling objects like stones. Bipedalism and utilizing handheld objects such as weapons may have aided early hominins in contest competition, reducing sexual selection pressures of maintaining large canine teeth. Several other traits in human males may have been selected for contest competition. Males exhibit a more robust face compared to females

. In other primates, the thumb is short and unable to touch the little finger. The ulnar opposition facilitates the precision grip and power grip of the human hand, underlying all the skilled manipulations

. As the human hand and arms adapted to the making of tools and were used less for climbing, the shoulder blades changed too. As a side effect, it allowed human ancestors to throw objects with greater force, speed and accuracy. The use of tools has been interpreted as a sign of intelligence, and it has been theorized that tool use may have stimulated certain aspects of human evolution, especially the continued expansion of the human brain

. He compared bones and muscles of human and chimpanzee thumbs, finding that humans have 3 muscles which are lacking in chimpanzees. Humans also have","According to the context, one adaptation in human hands is the ulnar opposition, which facilitates precision grip and power grip, underlying all skilled manipulations.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.0,The answer provides the correct concept but lacks detail and fails to mention the specific adaptation in human hands.
What percentage of lefthanded males exceeds that of females?,23%,". This may have provided protection against blows to the face during contest competitions as the areas on the skull that have increased robusticity are parts that are more likely to suffer from injury.

. Hominin hands are adapted for gripping tools or hurling objects like stones. Bipedalism and utilizing handheld objects such as weapons may have aided early hominins in contest competition, reducing sexual selection pressures of maintaining large canine teeth. Several other traits in human males may have been selected for contest competition. Males exhibit a more robust face compared to females

What percentage higher is the oxygen capacity rate of human males compared to females?,25-30%,". A higher pain tolerance allows for males to remain aggressive during contests along with an increased aerobic capacity. Males have an oxygen capacity rate that is 25–30% higher than females. This aerobic capacity increases during puberty when males are sexually maturing and preparing to mate. Human males engage in both within-group contest competition and coalitional aggression

. In all living hominid species, males are more muscular, allowing them to have more strength and power. Human males have 61% more overall muscle mass compared to females. This greater muscle mass allows males to gain greater acceleration, speed, and more powerful striking movements. Compared to females, human males exhibit more same-sex aggression, which peaks in young adulthood

. In females, superiority in verbal abilities, higher rule obedience, socialisation, empathy and agreeableness can be presented as a reflection of the systemic conservation function of the female sex. Male superiority is mostly noted in exploratory abilities - in risk- and sensation seeking, spacial orientation, physical strength and higher rates in physical aggression

What is a possible indicator of a male's genetic quality and/or ability to provide resources?,large body size and physical aggression,". The latter form competition may be supported by males tending to contribute more to a group task when competing against other groups and to discriminate more strongly against outgroup members. Traits that evolve during contest competition, such as large body size and physical aggression, are often costly to produce and maintain. These traits may therefore be indicators of male genetic quality and/or ability to provide resources and other direct benefits

. Further research also backs up the idea of using phenotypic traits as a means of assessing a potential mate's fitness for reproduction as well as assessing whether a partner has high genetic quality. One study proposed a link between Human Development Index levels and female preference for male facial appearance. While women from the United Kingdom preferred the faces of men with low cortisol levels, women from Latvia did not discriminate between men with either high or low levels of cortisol

What types of traits in human males may be selected to aid in hunting?,"Body size, strength, and weaponry usage",". Consequently, human females may evolve preferences for these traits, which then comprise an additional selection pressure. However, secondary sexual characteristics in human males do not always enhance overall attractiveness to females. Some traits of human males that function in contests, such as body size, strength, and weaponry usage, may also have been selected to aid in hunting

. Hunting often takes the hunter far away from the home base, selection would favor hunters who could find their way home without getting lost along the way. Locating and gathering edible nuts, berries, fruit, and tubers would require a different set of spatial skills. The high prevalence of male hunters and female gatherers among traditional societies, although not conclusive evidence, provides one more clue that both activities are part of the human pattern of procuring food

. Women in foraging societies do hunt small game regularly and, occasionally, large game. The majority of human's evolutionary history consisted of being hunter-gatherers as such women evolved the necessary traits needed for hunting such as endurance, movement coordination, and athleticism.

What kind of competition is observed in all great apes?,Contest competition,". However, contest competition is observed in all great apes and thus likely preceded hunting as a selective pressure. Human female mating competition is complex and multifaceted and varies across cultures, societies, and individuals

. Dominance has been associated with increased male mating success. Often contest competition produces anatomical weapons such as antlers or large canine teeth; however, hominids lack canine weaponry typical of other primates. Reduced canine size may be due to bipedalism and adaptations of the hand. Bipedalism is not a common trait, yet many species like the great apes stand on their hind legs when fighting, which increases power behind blows

. One notable finding is that nonhuman primates, including the other great apes, produce calls that are graded, as opposed to categorically differentiated, with listeners striving to evaluate subtle gradations in signallers' emotional and bodily states. Nonhuman apes seemingly find it extremely difficult to produce vocalisations in the absence of the corresponding emotional states

Although chimpanzees form male-male ","According to the context, contest competition is observed in all great apes.",0.7,0.8,0.9,0.6,0.8,"The LLM correctly identifies that contest competition is observed in all great apes, but it provides a rather generic and superficial description that does not provide any specific details about the nature of the competition."
What are some possible traits that high-quality mates might possess?,"Physical attractiveness, intelligence, or material resources",". Females may compete for high-quality mates who possess traits that indicate underlying genetic quality, possibly including physical attractiveness and intelligence, or material resources that can enhance the survival and reproductive success of the female and her offspring. Females may also compete for leadership and reputation in social alliances and networks that can provide support, protection, and mating opportunities

. Some of the factors that affect how females select their potential mates for reproduction include voice pitch, facial shape, muscular appearance, and particularly height; with the possibility of a Fisherian runaway in the making. Several studies suggest that there is a link between hormone levels and partner selection among humans

What is the typical role of human females in caring for their offspring?,Primary caregivers and protectors,". Human females compete with other females, sometimes including co-wives, to obtain and retain investment from mates, while managing cooperative same-sex relationships. Over human evolution, the cost of aggressive and physical contests in females may have been high given that females were the primary caregivers and protectors of offspring, so a mother's death greatly impacts infant mortality

The characteristics of the niche are largely the same as for social mammals, who evolved over 30 million years ago: soothing perinatal experience, several years of on-request breastfeeding, nearly constant affection or physical proximity, responsiveness to need (mitigating offspring distress), self-directed play, and for humans, multiple responsive caregivers. Initial studies show the importance of these components in early life for positive child outcomes

What is typically the form of female aggression compared to male aggression?,More indirect,". Some behaviors from mothers competing with other females at a similar life stage over resources include self-promotion and competitor derogation. However, maternal competition remains understudied. Compared to male aggression, female aggression tends to be more indirect

. Women are more likely to compete for desirable mates when maternal investment levels are high, and their social groups are largely composed of mothers, as more women living closer together are looking for similar resources that benefit their own survival and that of their children. Competition for mates among human females may take multiple forms. Contests tend to be less frequent, aggressive, and injurious than male-male contests. This leads to a difference in the traits selected

What is a common form of subtle aggression used by females as a competitive tool?,Gossip,". Females tend to engage in more subtle and indirect aggression, such as gossip, as a competitive tool to harm same-sex rivals' social opportunities and partake in competitor derogation to prevent female rivals from getting male attention. Gossip, derogation, and social exclusion grant the aggressor the chance to go undetected and avoid retaliation

What is the difference in the association between indirect peer victimization and suicide attempts between girls and boys?,"Girls' suicide attempts were associated with any amount of indirect peer victimization, whereas only frequent indirect peer victimization was associated with boys' suicide attempts.",". Derogation, for example, can eliminate same-sex rivals by reducing their ability to compete; it was found that girls' suicide attempts were associated with any amount of indirect peer victimization, whereas only frequent indirect peer victimization was associated with boys' suicide attempts

. Furthermore, same-sex harassment in some nonhuman animals impacted females' ovulation capabilities, which suggests that human females' reproductive success could be influenced by the stress induced by indirect or direct peer victimization

Has same-sex harassment been observed to affect nonhuman animals' reproductive success?,Yes,". Furthermore, same-sex harassment in some nonhuman animals impacted females' ovulation capabilities, which suggests that human females' reproductive success could be influenced by the stress induced by indirect or direct peer victimization

. Kristen Hawkes suggests further that obtaining resources intended for community consumption increases a male's fitness by appealing to the male's society and thus being in the good favor of both males and females. The male relationship would improve hunting success and create alliances for future conflict and the female relationship would improve direct reproductive success. Buss proposes alternate explanations of emergence of the strong male coalitions

What drives competitive females to spread reputation-harming information about other women?,Female mating competition for romantic partners,". Males pursue both sexually attractive and faithful long-term partners, which might be the source of female mating competition greatly revolving around denigrating same-sex rivals' attractiveness and reputation through accusations of promiscuity and infidelity. Competitive women are more likely to spread reputation-harming information about other women, suggesting that reputation manipulation is a form of female competition for romantic partners

. Females tend to engage in more subtle and indirect aggression, such as gossip, as a competitive tool to harm same-sex rivals' social opportunities and partake in competitor derogation to prevent female rivals from getting male attention.

What is the likelihood of women competing for desirable mates when maternal investment levels are high?,They are more likely,". Women are more likely to compete for desirable mates when maternal investment levels are high, and their social groups are largely composed of mothers, as more women living closer together are looking for similar resources that benefit their own survival and that of their children. Competition for mates among human females may take multiple forms. Contests tend to be less frequent, aggressive, and injurious than male-male contests. This leads to a difference in the traits selected

. Females may compete for high-quality mates who possess traits that indicate underlying genetic quality, possibly including physical attractiveness and intelligence, or material resources that can enhance the survival and reproductive success of the female and her offspring. Females may also compete for leadership and reputation in social alliances and networks that can provide support, protection, and mating opportunities

. Trivers posited that differential parental investment led to the evolution of sexual dimorphisms in mate choice, intra- and inter- sexual reproductive competition, and courtship displays. In mammals, including humans, females make a much larger parental investment than males (i.e","According to the context, when maternal investment levels are high, women are more likely to compete for desirable mates.",0.75,0.8,0.9,0.7,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies that women are more likely to compete for desirable mates when maternal investment levels are high, but it provides a low-quality answer due to the lack of specific context usage and the general nature of the provided context."
What is an example of indirect aggression that females can engage in?,via gossip,". The indirect aggression in which females engage can take the form of damaging the reputation of other women (e.g., via gossip), potentially influencing their sexual behavior and opportunities. Additionally, females compete with one another through male mate choice, e.g., by enhancing their own physical attractiveness.

However, it could have been more accurate to provide specific examples or mention the psychological impact of such behavior on the target women."
What is the reason why males tend to have lower pitched voices than females?,male intrasexual competition,". Femininity in the female face and voice provide cues to female reproductive hormones and reproductive potential. Males tend to have lower pitched voices than females, likely due to male intrasexual competition, but some evidence suggests that high female voice pitch may also be favored by male mate choice and function in intrasexual competition among females

. Ohala points out that if the lowered larynx were an adaptation for speech, adult human males would be expected to be better adapted in this respect than adult females, whose larynx is considerably less low. However, females outperform males in verbal tests, falsifying this whole line of reasoning. W. Tecumseh Fitch likewise argues that this was the original selective advantage of laryngeal lowering in the human species

. Ohala pointed out that if the lowered larynx were an adaptation for speech, we would expect adult human males to be better adapted in this respect than adult females, whose larynx is considerably less low.

In which environment(s) might women with larger breasts have an evolutionary advantage?,environments where resources may be low,". Deposition of fat on the hips, buttocks, and breasts in human females may also be an outcome of female sexual selection, signaling the ability to support gestation and lactation for offspring in environments where resources may be low. However, in the Western World, women with larger breasts are seen as more likely to commit infidelity and more likely to participate in intra-sexual competition with other females

. Consequently, human females may evolve preferences for these traits, which then comprise an additional selection pressure. However, secondary sexual characteristics in human males do not always enhance overall attractiveness to females. Some traits of human males that function in contests, such as body size, strength, and weaponry usage, may also have been selected to aid in hunting

"What is associated with increased fertility in young women, particularly those in subsistence societies?",Higher female body mass index (BMI),". Greater overall body fat percentage in human females appears to be unique among primates and may function in storing resources needed to gestate and support large-brained offspring as well as in sexual selection. For example, higher female body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased fertility in young women, particularly those in subsistence societies. Lower WHR, lower BMI, and smaller waist sizes are also associated with lower birth weights and higher infant mortality

. The increased brain growth after birth and the increased dependency of children on mothers had a major effect upon the female reproductive cycle, and the more frequent appearance of alloparenting in humans when compared with other hominids

. In addition, subsistence labor differentiates as observations suggests gender patterns originate from genetic traits. Another possible explanation for women gathering is their inherent prioritization of rearing offspring, which is difficult to uphold if women were hunting. Hunting is seen as more cost effective for men than for women. The division of labor allows both types of resources (animals and plants) to be utilized

. Kristen Hawkes suggests further that obtai",Higher female body mass index (BMI).,0.95,0.9,0.85,0.8,0.0,The LLM's answer is relevant but provides only a surface-level description. It fails to capture the nuance of how body fat distribution can impact fertility in different contexts.
It has been suggested that women who are nearing ovulation were more likely to be judged as what?,more attractive,". Known as the ovulatory shift hypothesis, the theory posits that, during the ovulatory phase of a woman's cycle (approximately days 10–15 of a woman's cycle), a woman who mated with a male with high genetic quality would have been more likely, on average, to produce and bear a healthy offspring than a woman who mated with a male with low genetic quality

. These putative preferences are predicted to be especially apparent for short-term mating domains because a potential male mate would only be offering genes to a potential offspring. This hypothesis allows researchers to examine whether women select mates who have characteristics that indicate high genetic quality during the high fertility phase of their ovulatory cycles. Indeed, studies have shown that women's preferences vary across the ovulatory cycle

. Furthermore, same-sex harassment in some nonhuman animals impacted females' ovulation capabilities, which suggests that human females' reproductive success could be influenced by the stress induced by indirect or direct peer victimization

However, the LLM's answer could be improved by providing a more comprehensive analysis of the topic and referencing relevant scientific research."
Do the ovulatory cycle changes in facial and vocal attractiveness in humans show patterns consistent with fertility-related increases?,Yes,". Facial and vocal attractiveness have been observed to change with estradiol and progesterone in pattens consistent with fertility-related increases, although some data challenge this interpretation. In general, ovulatory cycle changes are more subtle than in non-human primates, perhaps representing leakage of information on fertility and hormonal status rather than signals functioning to convey this information

. There is further evidence from the same study that in fertile stages of the menstrual cycle, women also had a preference for other masculine traits such as body size, facial shape, and dominant behavior, which are indicators of both fertility and health. This study did not exclude males with feminine traits from being selected, however, as feminine traits in men indicate a higher probability of long-term relationship commitment, and may be one of several evolutionary strategies

. In a study measuring female attraction to males with varying levels of masculinity, it was established that women had a general masculinity preference for men's voices, and that the preference for masculinity was greater in the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle than in the non-fertile phase","According to the context, the answer is:

"According to John Manning's view, what was more important for the evolution of the darkest skin types: antimicrobial properties or protection from ultraviolet light?",Antimicrobial properties,". John Manning suggests that where polygyny is common, there is also a higher disease burden, resulting in selection for antimicrobial resistance. In this view, the antimicrobial properties of melanin help mitigate the susceptibility to disease in sub-Saharan Africa. According to this argument, the anti-infective qualities of melanin were more important than protection from ultraviolet light in the evolution of the darkest skin types

"According to the context, what is considered more attractive than European women?",Women with the facial features and pigmentary characteristics of East Asian women,". Anthropologist Peter Frost has proposed that sexual selection for women with unusual hair or eye color was responsible for the evolution of pigmentary traits in European populations, however this theory has since been refuted by data-based evidence from genetics and spectrophotometry, and multiple studies have shown that women with the facial features and pigmentary characteristics of East Asian women are considered more attractive than European women

Further research also backs up the idea of using phenotypic traits as a means of assessing a potential mate's fitness for reproduction as well as assessing whether a partner has high genetic quality. One study proposed a link between Human Development Index levels and female preference for male facial appearance. While women from the United Kingdom preferred the faces of men with low cortisol levels, women from Latvia did not discriminate between men with either high or low levels of cortisol

In a study measuring female attraction to males with varying levels of masculinity, it was established that women had a general masculinity preference for men's voices, and that the preference for masculinity was greater in the fertile ph","According to the context, women with the facial features and pigmentary characteristics of East Asian women are considered more attractive than European women.",0.7,0.8,0.6,0.9,0.0,The LLM generated answer is somewhat relevant but not faithful to the ground truth.

"According to Geoffrey Miller's hypothesis, what kind of behaviors can play a role despite not being clearly tied to survival benefits?","Humor, music, visual art, some forms of altruism, verbal creativity",". Geoffrey Miller, drawing on some of Darwin's largely neglected ideas about human behavior, has hypothesized that many human behaviors not clearly tied to survival benefits, such as humor, music, visual art, some forms of altruism, verbal creativity, or the fact that most humans have a far greater vocabulary than that which is required for survival, can nevertheless play a role

. While groups may benefit from avoiding certain behaviors, those harmful behaviors have the same effect regardless of whether the offending individuals are aware of them or not. Since the individuals themselves can increase their reproductive success by doing many of them, any characteristics that entail impunity are positively selected by evolution

However, the gathering hypothesis cannot account for sexual division of labor in men hunting and women gathering, high parental investment of human males, male coalition psychology, why humans live in environments without plant resources, human gut structure versus primate gut structure, reciprocal alliances (alliance theory), and why women share food

Do males make greater use of lower-frequency (more unusual) words when in a romantic mindset compared to a non-romantic mindset?,Yes,". Miller (2000) has proposed that this apparent redundancy is due to individuals using vocabulary to demonstrate their intelligence, and consequently their ""fitness"", to potential mates. This has been tested experimentally, and it appears that males do make greater use of lower-frequency (more unusual) words when in a romantic mindset compared to a non-romantic mindset, suggesting that vocabulary is likely to be used as a sexual display (Rosenberg & Tunney, 2008)

. In a study measuring female attraction to males with varying levels of masculinity, it was established that women had a general masculinity preference for men's voices, and that the preference for masculinity was greater in the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle than in the non-fertile phase

. The high rates of communicative disorders and psychopathy in males might facilitate their higher rates of disengagement from normative expectations and their insensitivity to social disapproval, when they deliberately do not follow social norms. Some of these speculations have yet to be developed into fully testable hypotheses, and a great deal of research is required to confirm their validity

What is Miller's view on how human culture arose?,Through sexual selection for creative traits,". All these qualities are considered courtship adaptations that have been favored through sexual selection. Miller is critical of theories that imply that human culture arose as accidents or by-products of human evolution. He believes that human culture arose through sexual selection for creative traits. In that view, many human artifacts could be considered subject to sexual selection as part of the extended phenotype, for instance clothing that enhances sexually selected traits

. DIT makes three main claims: The human capacity to store and transmit culture arose from genetically evolved psychological mechanisms. This implies that at some point during the evolution of the human species a type of social learning leading to cumulative cultural evolution was evolutionarily advantageous. Social learning processes give rise to cultural evolution

When did the second period of brain expansion occur?,"500,000 years ago",". During human evolution, on at least two occasions, hominid brain size increased rapidly over a short period of time followed by a period of stasis. The first period of brain expansion occurred 2.5 million years ago, when Homo habilis first began using stone tools. The second period occurred 500,000 years ago, with the emergence of archaic Homo sapiens

. This brain increase manifested during postnatal brain growth, far exceeding that of other apes (heterochrony). It also allowed for extended periods of social learning and language acquisition in juvenile humans, beginning as much as 2 million years ago. Encephalization may be due to a dependency on calorie-dense, difficult-to-acquire food. Furthermore, the changes in the structure of human brains may be even more significant than the increase in size

. During the next million years a process of rapid encephalization occurred, and with the arrival of Homo erectus and Homo ergaster in the fossil record, cranial capacity had doubled to 850 cm3. (Such an increase in human brain size is equivalent to each generation having 125,000 more neurons than their parents.) It is believed that H. erectus and H

What is the concept referred to by Tor Nørretranders as an example of the handicap principle?,The peacock's tail,". Miller argues that the rapid increases in brain size would have occurred by a positive feedback loop resulting in a Fisherian runaway selection for larger brains. Tor Nørretranders, in The Generous Man conjectures how intelligence, musicality, artistic and social skills, and language might have evolved as an example of the handicap principle, analogously with the peacock's tail, the standard example of that principle

. Additional information regarding these principles may be found in the table below. Adaptation works within constraints, makes compromises and trade-offs, and occurs in the context of different forms of competition. Adaptations can only occur if they are evolvable. Some adaptations which would prevent ill health are therefore not possible. Other constraints occur as the byproduct of adaptive innovations

. These theories help to explain the development of altruistic behavior, and account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism). Several mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology.

When was the controversy over the role of sexual selection in human evolution sparked?,1871,". The role of sexual selection in human evolution has been considered controversial from the moment of publication of Darwin's book on sexual selection (1871)

. The role of sexual selection in human evolution has not been firmly established although neoteny has been cited as being caused by human sexual selection. It has been suggested that sexual selection played a part in the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain, i.e

. Sexual selection's role in human evolution cannot be definitively established, as features may result from an equilibrium among competing selective pressures, some involving sexual selection, others natural selection, and others pleiotropy. Richard Dawkins argued that Charles Darwin described sexual selection as depending on ""the advantage which certain individuals have over others of the same sex and species, solely in respect of reproduction""

. This view proposes that the derivation of anatomically modern human populations from H. erectus at the beginning of the Pleistocene 1.8 million years BP, has taken place within a continuous world population. The hypothesis necessarily rejects the assumption of an infertility barrier between ancient Eurasian ","According to the context, the controversy over the role of sexual selection in human evolution was sparked from the moment of publication of Darwin's book on sexual selection (1871).",0.75,0.85,0.95,0.8,0.9,"The LLM correctly identifies the year of the publication of Darwin's book as the origin of the controversy, but it provides no other relevant information or context to support its claim."
What was Alfred Wallace's stance on the origin of human mind?,non-material,". Among his vocal critics were some of Darwin's supporters, such as Alfred Wallace, a believer in spiritualism and a non-material origin of the human mind, who argued that animals and birds do not choose mates based on sexual selection, and that the artistic faculties in humans belong to their spiritual nature and therefore cannot be connected to natural selection, which only affects the animal nature

. Even many of Darwin's original supporters (such as Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Lyell) balked at the idea that human beings could have evolved their apparently boundless mental capacities and moral sensibilities through natural selection. Prior to the general acceptance of Africa as the root of genus Homo, 19th-century naturalists sought the origin of humans in Asia

. Huxley argued for human evolution from apes by illustrating many of the similarities and differences between humans and other apes, and did so particularly in his 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Many of Darwin's early supporters (such as Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Lyell) did not initially agree that the origin of the mental capacities and the moral sensibilities of humans could be explaine","According to the context, Alfred Wallace believed in a non-material origin of the human mind.

What does the term 'biped' refer to?,'Two feet',". Darwin was accused of looking to the evolution of early human ancestors through the moral codes of the 19th century Victorian society. --- # Bipedalism#Evolution of human bipedalism Bipedalism is a form of terrestrial locomotion where an animal moves by means of its two rear (or lower) limbs or legs. An animal or machine that usually moves in a bipedal manner is known as a biped /ˈbaɪpɛd/, meaning 'two feet' (from Latin bis 'double' and pes 'foot')

. This article therefore avoids the terms ""facultative"" and ""obligate"", and focuses on the range of styles of locomotion normally used by various groups of animals. Normal humans may be considered ""obligate"" bipeds because the alternatives are very uncomfortable and usually only resorted to when walking is impossible. There are a number of states of movement commonly associated with bipedalism

. Bipedality in kangaroo rats has been hypothesized to improve locomotor performance, [clarification needed] which could aid in escaping from predators. Zoologists often label behaviors, including bipedalism, as ""facultative"" (i.e. optional) or ""obligate"" (the animal has no reasonable alternative). Even this distinction is not completely clear-","According to the context, a ""biped"" refers to an animal or machine that usually moves in a bipedal manner, meaning it uses its two rear (or lower) limbs or legs. In other words, it is an animal or object that walks on two feet.",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.9,1.0,"The LLM correctly identifies that a 'biped' refers to an animal that moves with its two rear limbs or lower legs. However, it could have been more accurate if it had considered other forms of terrestrial locomotion, such as quadrupedal or monotropic movement."
What type of movement do some species of archosaurs develop in the Triassic period?,Bipedalism,". Types of bipedal movement include walking or running (a bipedal gait) and hopping. Several groups of modern species are habitual bipeds whose normal method of locomotion is two-legged. In the Triassic period some groups of archosaurs (a group that includes crocodiles and dinosaurs) developed bipedalism; among the dinosaurs, all the early forms and many later groups were habitual or exclusive bipeds; the birds are members of a clade of exclusively bipedal dinosaurs, the theropods

. Bipedal movement also re-evolved in a number of other dinosaur lineages such as the iguanodonts. Some extinct members of Pseudosuchia, a sister group to the avemetatarsalians (the group including dinosaurs and relatives), also evolved bipedal forms – a poposauroid from the Triassic, Effigia okeeffeae, is thought to have been bipedal. Pterosaurs were previously thought to have been bipedal, but recent trackways have all shown quadrupedal locomotion

. Dinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late Triassic period, roughly 20 million years after the Permian-Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95 percent of all life on Earth. Ra","According to the context, some groups of archosaurs developed bipedalism in the Triassic period.",0.7,0.6,0.8,0.5,0.9,"The context mentions that some groups of archosaurs developed bipedalism in the Triassic period, but it does not provide specific details about the type of movement they developed or how they used their limbs."
Which group among mammals has evolved habitual bipedalism multiple times?,"The hominin apes, including humans",". Within mammals, habitual bipedalism has evolved multiple times, with the macropods, kangaroo rats and mice, springhare, hopping mice, pangolins and hominin apes (australopithecines, including humans) as well as various other extinct groups evolving the trait independently. A larger number of modern species intermittently or briefly use a bipedal gait. Several lizard species move bipedally when running, usually to escape from threats

. A number of groups of extant mammals have independently evolved bipedalism as their main form of locomotion – for example, humans, ground pangolins, the extinct giant ground sloths, numerous species of jumping rodents and macropods. Humans, as their bipedalism has been extensively studied, are documented in the next section. Macropods are believed to have evolved bipedal hopping only once in their evolution, at some time no later than 45 million years ago

. Types of bipedal movement include walking or running (a bipedal gait) and hopping. Several groups of modern species are habitual bipeds whose normal method of locomotion is two-legged.

So, the correct answer is: These groups of mammals.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.8,"The LLM correctly identifies the main groups that have evolved habitual bipedalism multiple times: Macropods, Kangaroo rats and mice, Springhare, Hopping mice, Pangolins and Hominin apes (including humans)."
What is a common behavior exhibited by some primate and bear species?,Walking bipedally,". Many primate and bear species will adopt a bipedal gait in order to reach food or explore their environment, though there are a few cases where they walk on their hind limbs only. Several arboreal primate species, such as gibbons and indriids, exclusively walk on two legs during the brief periods they spend on the ground. Many animals rear up on their hind legs while fighting or copulating

. Monkeys and apes rely on a repertoire of species-specific ""gesture-calls"" – emotionally-expressive vocalisations inseparable from the visual displays which accompany them. Humans also have species-specific gesture-calls – laughs, cries, sobs, etc. – together with involuntary gestures accompanying speech. Many animal displays are polymodal in that each appears designed to exploit multiple channels simultaneously

. Evidence of a rich cognitive life in primate relatives of humans is extensive, and a wide range of specific behaviours in line with Darwinian theory is well documented. However, until recently, research has disregarded nonhuman primates in the context of evolutionary linguistics, primarily because unlike vocal learning birds, our closest relatives seem to lack imitative abilities

",A common behavior exhibited by some primate and bear species is adopting a bipedal gait in order to reach food or explore their environment.,1.0,0.8,0.75,0.5,0.0,"The answer is somewhat correct, but it provides insufficient information about the specific behavior of primate and bear species. It should specify that the behavior is observed in some species, but not all, and that there are exceptions where the species walks on their hind limbs only."
What does the prefix 'bi-' mean in the word 'bipedally'?,Two,". Darwin was accused of looking to the evolution of early human ancestors through the moral codes of the 19th century Victorian society. --- # Bipedalism#Evolution of human bipedalism Bipedalism is a form of terrestrial locomotion where an animal moves by means of its two rear (or lower) limbs or legs. An animal or machine that usually moves in a bipedal manner is known as a biped /ˈbaɪpɛd/, meaning 'two feet' (from Latin bis 'double' and pes 'foot')

. Some animals commonly stand on their hind legs to reach food, keep watch, threaten a competitor or predator, or pose in courtship, but do not move bipedally. The word is derived from the Latin words bi(s) 'two' and ped- 'foot', as contrasted with quadruped 'four feet'. Limited and exclusive bipedalism can offer a species several advantages

What is one of the benefits of bipedalism for animals?,access to higher food sources with their mouths,". Bipedalism raises the head; this allows a greater field of vision with improved detection of distant dangers or resources, access to deeper water for wading animals and allows the animals to reach higher food sources with their mouths. While upright, non-locomotory limbs become free for other uses, including manipulation (in primates and rodents), flight (in birds), digging (in the giant pangolin), combat (in bears, great apes and the large monitor lizard) or camouflage

. Only after the more demanding posture was enabled by changes in the nervous system, could advantages of bipedal over quadrupedal locomotion be utilized, including better scanning of the environment, carrying food and infants, simultaneous upper extremity movements and observation of the environment, limitless manipulation of objects with upper extremities, and less space for rotating around the Z-axis

What is the maximum speed that an ostrich and a red kangaroo can reach?,70 km/h (43 mph),". The maximum bipedal speed appears slower than the maximum speed of quadrupedal movement with a flexible backbone – both the ostrich and the red kangaroo can reach speeds of 70 km/h (43 mph), while the cheetah can exceed 100 km/h (62 mph). Even though bipedalism is slower at first, over long distances, it has allowed humans to outrun most other animals according to the endurance running hypothesis

. The great majority of living terrestrial vertebrates are quadrupeds, with bipedalism exhibited by only a handful of living groups. Humans, gibbons and large birds walk by raising one foot at a time. On the other hand, most macropods, smaller birds, lemurs and bipedal rodents move by hopping on both legs simultaneously. Tree kangaroos are able to walk or hop, most commonly alternating feet when moving arboreally and hopping on both feet simultaneously when on the ground

. Bipedal movement is less common among mammals, most of which are quadrupedal. All primates possess some bipedal ability, though most species primarily use quadrupedal locomotion on land. Primates aside, the macropods (kangaroos, wallabies and their relatives), kangaroo rats and mice, hopping mice and springhare move ","According to the context, both the ostrich and the red kangaroo can reach speeds of 70 km/h (43 mph).",1.0,0.8,0.75,0.6,0.0,The LLM correctly identifies the maximum speed of both the ostrich and the red kangaroo as 70 km/h (43 mph).
What type of behavior does zoologists label as 'facultative'?,Optional,". Bipedality in kangaroo rats has been hypothesized to improve locomotor performance, [clarification needed] which could aid in escaping from predators. Zoologists often label behaviors, including bipedalism, as ""facultative"" (i.e. optional) or ""obligate"" (the animal has no reasonable alternative). Even this distinction is not completely clear-cut — for example, humans other than infants normally walk and run in biped fashion, but almost all can crawl on hands and knees when necessary

. Evolutionary psychologists respond that they are working within a nature-nurture interactionist framework that acknowledges that many psychological adaptations are facultative (sensitive to environmental variations during individual development). The discipline is generally not focused on proximate analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations)

Normal humans may be considered ""obligate"" bipeds because the alternatives are very uncomfortable and usuall","According to the context, zoologists label behaviors such as bipedalism (in kangaroo rats) as ""facultative"", meaning that it is an optional behavior.",0.75,0.9,0.8,0.5,0.7,"The LLM correctly identifies the behavior as optional, but its relevance and similarity scores could be improved."
What is a common reason for people walking on all fours with their feet but not their knees?,Injury or illness,". There are even reports of humans who normally walk on all fours with their feet but not their knees on the ground, but these cases are a result of conditions such as Uner Tan syndrome — very rare genetic neurological disorders rather than normal behavior. Even if one ignores exceptions caused by some kind of injury or illness, there are many unclear cases, including the fact that ""normal"" humans can crawl on hands and knees

. Humans walk with their knees kept straight and the thighs bent inward so that the knees are almost directly under the body, rather than out to the side, as is the case in ancestral hominids. This type of gait also aids balance. An increase in leg length since the evolution of bipedalism changed how leg muscles functioned in upright gait. In humans, the push for walking comes from the leg muscles acting at the ankle

. Some animals commonly stand on their hind legs to reach food, keep watch, threaten a competitor or predator, or pose in courtship, but do not move bipedally. The word is derived from the Latin words bi(s) 'two' and ped- 'foot', as contrasted with quadruped 'four feet'. Limited and exclusive bipedalism can offer a species several advantages

What is the term used in the article to describe normal humans' ability to walk?,obligate,". This article therefore avoids the terms ""facultative"" and ""obligate"", and focuses on the range of styles of locomotion normally used by various groups of animals. Normal humans may be considered ""obligate"" bipeds because the alternatives are very uncomfortable and usually only resorted to when walking is impossible. There are a number of states of movement commonly associated with bipedalism

. The general form of human locomotion is markedly distinct from all other animals observed in nature. The unique manner of human locomotion has been described in the Journal of Anatomy: ""… no animal walks or runs as we do. We keep the trunk erect; in walking, our knees are almost straight at mid-stance; the forces our feet exert on the ground are very markedly two-peaked when we walk fast; and in walking and usually in running, we strike the ground initially with the heel alone

. Rather, walking is characterized by an ""inverted pendulum"" movement in which the center of gravity vaults over a stiff leg with each step. Force plates can be used to quantify the whole-body kinetic & potential energy, with walking displaying an out-of-phase relationship indicating exchange between the two. This m","According to the context, the article does not use a specific term to describe normal humans' ability to walk.

Primates aside, the macropods (kangaroos, wallabies and their relatives), kangaroo rats and mice, hopping mice and springhare move bipedally by hopping. Very few non-primate mammals commonly move bipedally with an alternating leg gait

. Geladas, although usually quadrupedal, will sometimes move between adjacent feeding patches with a squatting, shuffling bipedal form of locomotion. However, they can only do so for brief amounts, as their bodies are not adapted for constant bipedal locomotion. Humans are the only primates who are normally biped, due to an extra curve in the spine which stabilizes the upright","Based on the context, it can be inferred that gibbons walk exclusively on two legs during brief periods they spend on the ground.

What is the first known biped?,Eudibamus,". Many species of lizards become bipedal during high-speed, sprint locomotion, including the world's fastest lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (genus Ctenosaura). The first known biped is the bolosaurid Eudibamus whose fossils date from 290 million years ago. Its long hind-legs, short forelegs, and distinctive joints all suggest bipedalism. The species became extinct in the early Permian. All birds are bipeds, as is the case for all theropod dinosaurs

. The non-bipedal knuckle-walkers, the gorillas and chimpanzees, diverged from the hominin line over a period covering the same time, so either Sahelanthropus or Orrorin may be our last shared ancestor. Ardipithecus, a full biped, arose approximately 5.6 million years ago. The early bipeds eventually evolved into the australopithecines and still later into the genus Homo. There are several theories of the adaptation value of bipedalism

. The evolution of human bipedalism began in primates about four million years ago, or as early as seven million years ago with Sahelanthropus or about 12 million years ago with Danuvius guggenmosi. One hypothesis for human bipedalism is that it evolved as a result of differentially successful survival ","According to the context, the first known biped is the bolosaurid Eudibamus, whose fossils date from 290 million years ago.",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.9,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the name of the first known biped as the bolosaurid Eudibamus, which is consistent with the ground truth answer."
What is a characteristic of hoatzin chicks?,They have claws on their wings,". However, hoatzin chicks have claws on their wings which they use for climbing. Bipedalism evolved more than once in archosaurs, the group that includes both dinosaurs and crocodilians. All dinosaurs are thought to be descended from a fully bipedal ancestor, perhaps similar to Eoraptor

. Sexual selection could also favor blond hair. The technique also enabled them to track the selection of polygenic traits—those affected by a multitude of genes, rather than just one—such as height, infant head circumferences, and female hip sizes (crucial for giving birth). They found that natural selection has been favoring increased height and larger head and female hip sizes among Britons. Moreover, lactase persistence showed signs of active selection during the same period

. In contrast, gorillas living in harems exhibit a much stronger sexual dimorphism (see: homininae). The theory of sexual selection has been used to explain a number of human anatomical features. These include rounded breasts, facial hair, pubic hair and penis size. The breasts of primates are flat, yet are able to produce sufficient milk for feeding their young. The breasts of non-lactating human females are filled with f","According to the context, a characteristic of hoatzin chicks is that they have claws on their wings which they use for climbing.",1.0,0.7,0.8,0.8,0.0,The LLM correctly identified that the characteristic of hoatzin chicks is that they have claws on their wings which they use for climbing.
When did dinosaurs diverge from their archosaur ancestors?,approximately 230 million years ago,". Dinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late Triassic period, roughly 20 million years after the Permian-Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95 percent of all life on Earth. Radiometric dating of fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time

. Initial divergence occurred sometime between 7 to 13 million years ago, but ongoing hybridization blurred the separation and delayed complete separation during several millions of years. Patterson (2006) dated the final divergence at 5 to 6 million years ago

. In their seminal 1967 paper in Science, Sarich and Wilson estimated the divergence time of humans and apes as four to five million years ago, at a time when standard interpretations of the fossil record gave this divergence as at least 10 to as much as 30 million years.

What was the locomotion of pterosaurs?,quadrupedal,". Bipedal movement also re-evolved in a number of other dinosaur lineages such as the iguanodonts. Some extinct members of Pseudosuchia, a sister group to the avemetatarsalians (the group including dinosaurs and relatives), also evolved bipedal forms – a poposauroid from the Triassic, Effigia okeeffeae, is thought to have been bipedal. Pterosaurs were previously thought to have been bipedal, but recent trackways have all shown quadrupedal locomotion

. Types of bipedal movement include walking or running (a bipedal gait) and hopping. Several groups of modern species are habitual bipeds whose normal method of locomotion is two-legged. In the Triassic period some groups of archosaurs (a group that includes crocodiles and dinosaurs) developed bipedalism; among the dinosaurs, all the early forms and many later groups were habitual or exclusive bipeds; the birds are members of a clade of exclusively bipedal dinosaurs, the theropods

When did macropods evolve bipedal hopping?,no later than 45 million years ago,". A number of groups of extant mammals have independently evolved bipedalism as their main form of locomotion – for example, humans, ground pangolins, the extinct giant ground sloths, numerous species of jumping rodents and macropods. Humans, as their bipedalism has been extensively studied, are documented in the next section. Macropods are believed to have evolved bipedal hopping only once in their evolution, at some time no later than 45 million years ago

Which primates are known to exhibit bipedalism?,"Chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, gibbons and baboons",". The primate version of bipedalism is unusual because the back is close to upright (completely upright in humans), and the tail may be absent entirely. Many primates can stand upright on their hind legs without any support. Chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, gibbons and baboons exhibit forms of bipedalism. On the ground sifakas move like all indrids with bipedal sideways hopping movements of the hind legs, holding their forelimbs up for balance

. Many primate and bear species will adopt a bipedal gait in order to reach food or explore their environment, though there are a few cases where they walk on their hind limbs only. Several arboreal primate species, such as gibbons and indriids, exclusively walk on two legs during the brief periods they spend on the ground. Many animals rear up on their hind legs while fighting or copulating

On the ground sifakas move like all indrids with bipedal sideways hopping movements of the hind legs, holding their forelimbs up for balance

. Apes have vertical femurs, while humans have femurs that are slightly angled medially from the hip to the knee, thus making human knees closer together and under the body's center of gravity.

When did the evolution of human bipedalism begin in primates?,About four million years ago,". The evolution of human bipedalism began in primates about four million years ago, or as early as seven million years ago with Sahelanthropus or about 12 million years ago with Danuvius guggenmosi. One hypothesis for human bipedalism is that it evolved as a result of differentially successful survival from carrying food to share with group members, although there are alternative hypotheses. Injured chimpanzees and bonobos have been capable of sustained bipedalism

. --- # Human skeletal changes due to bipedalism The evolution of human bipedalism, which began in primates approximately four million years ago, or as early as seven million years ago with Sahelanthropus, or approximately twelve million years ago with Danuvius guggenmosi, has led to morphological alterations to the human skeleton including changes to the arrangement, shape, and size of the bones of the foot, hip, knee, leg, and the vertebral column

What was the condition that caused Natasha to switch to exclusive bipedalism?,An illness,". Three captive primates, one macaque Natasha and two chimps, Oliver and Poko (chimpanzee), were found to move bipedally. Natasha switched to exclusive bipedalism after an illness, while Poko was discovered in captivity in a tall, narrow cage. Oliver reverted to knuckle-walking after developing arthritis. Non-human primates often use bipedal locomotion when carrying food, or while moving through shallow water. Other mammals engage in limited, non-locomotory, bipedalism

. In addition to the change in shoulder stability, changing locomotion would have increased the demand for shoulder mobility, which would have propelled the evolution of bipedalism forward. The different hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive and a number of selective forces may have acted together to lead to human bipedalism. It is important to distinguish between adaptations for bipedalism and adaptations for running, which came later still

. Physical constraints have made it difficult to modify the joints for further stability while maintaining efficiency of locomotion. There have been multiple theories as to why bipedalism was favored, thus leading to skeletal changes that aided the upward gait.

Can dogs walk bipedally?,No,". Ground squirrels and meerkats will stand on hind legs to survey their surroundings, but will not walk bipedally. Dogs (e.g. Faith) can stand or move on two legs if trained, or if birth defect or injury precludes quadrupedalism.

What type of animal will walk on its front legs when threatened?,The spotted skunk,". The spotted skunk will walk on its front legs when threatened, rearing up on its front legs while facing the attacker so that its anal glands, capable of spraying an offensive oil, face its attacker. Bipedalism is unknown among the amphibians. Among the non-archosaur reptiles bipedalism is rare, but it is found in the ""reared-up"" running of lizards such as agamids and monitor lizards.

Bipedalism is rarely found outside terrestrial animals, though at least two species of octopus walk bipedally on the sea floor using two of their arms, allowing the remaining arms to be used to camouflage the octopus as a mat of algae or a floating coconut

. Many species of lizards become bipedal during high-speed, sprint locomotion, including the world's fastest lizard, the spiny-tailed iguana (genus Ctenosaura). The first known biped is the bolosaurid Eudibamus whose fossils date from 290 million years ago. Its long hind-legs, short forelegs, and distinctive joints all suggest bipedalism. The species became extinct in the early Permian. All birds are bipeds, as is the case for all theropod dinosaurs

. The maximum bipedal speed appears slower than the maximum speed of quadrupedal movement with a flexible backbone – both the ostrich and the red kangaroo can reach speeds of 70 km/h (43 mph), while the cheetah can exceed 100 km/h (62 mph).

What is the estimated age of Australopithecus fossils with bipedal specializations?,4.2 to 3.9 million years ago,". There are at least twelve distinct hypotheses as to how and why bipedalism evolved in humans, and also some debate as to when. Bipedalism evolved well before the large human brain or the development of stone tools. Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago and recent studies have suggested that obligate bipedal hominid species were present as early as 7 million years ago

What is the term for the opening in the cranium where the spinal cord leaves?,Foramen Magnum,". Nonetheless, the evolution of bipedalism was accompanied by significant evolutions in the spine including the forward movement in position of the foramen magnum, where the spinal cord leaves the cranium. Recent evidence regarding modern human sexual dimorphism (physical differences between male and female) in the lumbar spine has been seen in pre-modern primates such as Australopithecus africanus

. They also noted that the base of the skull stopped growing with the brain by the end of juvenility, whereas in chimps it continues growing with the rest of the body into adulthood; and considered this evidence of a switch from a gross skeletal anatomy trajectory to a neurological development trajectory due to selective pressure for sociability. Nonetheless, their conclusions are highly speculative

. The foramen magnum is located inferiorly under the skull, which puts much of the weight of the head behind the spine. The flat human face helps to maintain balance on the occipital condyles. Because of this, the erect position of the head is possible without the prominent supraorbital ridges and the strong muscular attachments found in, for example, apes. As a result, in humans the muscle","According to the context, the answer is:

What is one reason why females in a particular primate group may have evolved a dimorphism?,to bear lumbar load better during pregnancy,". This dimorphism has been seen as an evolutionary adaptation of females to bear lumbar load better during pregnancy, an adaptation that non-bipedal primates would not need to make. Adapting bipedalism would have required less shoulder stability, which allowed the shoulder and other limbs to become more independent of each other and adapt for specific suspensory behaviors

. However, while both gibbons and hominids have reduced canine sexual dimorphism, female gibbons enlarge ('masculinize') their canines so they can actively share in the defense of their home territory. Instead, the reduction of the male hominid canine is consistent with reduced inter-male aggression in a pair-bonded though group living primate. Recent studies of 4.4 million years old Ardipithecus ramidus suggest bipedalism

. In contrast, gorillas living in harems exhibit a much stronger sexual dimorphism (see: homininae). The theory of sexual selection has been used to explain a number of human anatomical features. These include rounded breasts, facial hair, pubic hair and penis size. The breasts of primates are flat, yet are able to produce sufficient milk for feeding their young.

What was a key factor in the evolution of bipedalism?,Increased demand for shoulder mobility,". Napier (1963) argued that it is unlikely that a single factor drove the evolution of bipedalism. He stated ""It seems unlikely that any single factor was responsible for such a dramatic change in behaviour.

What type of locomotion is thought to have been advantageous for early humans living in a forested setting?,Bipedal locomotion in trees,". The form and function of modern-day humans' upper bodies appear to have evolved from living in a more forested setting. Living in this kind of environment would have made it so that being able to travel arboreally would have been advantageous at the time. Although different to human walking, bipedal locomotion in trees was thought to be advantageous

. The fossil evidence reveals that early bipedal hominins were still adapted to climbing trees at the time they were also walking upright. It is possible that bipedalism evolved in the trees, and was later applied to the savanna as a vestigial trait

. Early hominines such as Ardipithecus ramidus may have possessed an arboreal type of bipedalism that later independently evolved towards knuckle-walking in chimpanzees and gorillas and towards efficient walking and running in modern humans (see figure). It is also proposed that one cause of Neanderthal extinction was a less efficient running

Was it suggested that early hominins underwent a knuckle-walking stage before adapting their back limbs for bipedality?,Yes,". It has also been proposed that, like some modern-day apes, early hominins had undergone a knuckle-walking stage prior to adapting the back limbs for bipedality while retaining forearms capable of grasping

. One of the proposed mechanisms was the knuckle-walking hypothesis, which states that human ancestors used quadrupedal locomotion on the savanna, as evidenced by morphological characteristics found in Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus afarensis forelimbs, and that it is less parsimonious to assume that knuckle walking developed twice in genera Pan and Gorilla instead of evolving it once as synapomorphy for Pan and Gorilla before losing it in Australopithecus

Numerous causes for the evolution of human bipedalism involve freeing the hands for carrying and using tools, sexual dimorphism in provisioning, changes in climate and environment (from jungle to savanna) that favored a more elevated eye-position, and to reduce the amount of skin exposed to the tropical sun. It is possible that bipedalism provided a variety of benefits to the hominin species, and scientists have suggested multiple reasons for evolution of human bipedalism

What is one reason why early hominins may have become more bipedal over time?,settling on the ground,". There is also not only the question of why the earliest hominins were partially bipedal but also why hominins became more bipedal over time. For example, the postural feeding hypothesis describes how the earliest hominins became bipedal for the benefit of reaching food in trees while the savanna-based theory describes how the late hominins that started to settle on the ground became increasingly bipedal

. Why did hominins become more bipedal over time? He argued that these questions can be answered with combination of prominent theories such as Savanna-based, Postural feeding, and Provisioning. According to the Savanna-based theory, hominines came down from the tree's branches and adapted to life on the savanna by walking erect on two feet. The theory suggests that early hominids were forced to adapt to bipedal locomotion on the open savanna after they left the trees

What did Napier argue about the evolution of bipedalism?,It is unlikely that a single factor drove its evolution.,". Napier (1963) argued that it is unlikely that a single factor drove the evolution of bipedalism. He stated ""It seems unlikely that any single factor was responsible for such a dramatic change in behaviour. In addition to the advantages of accruing from ability to carry objects – food or otherwise – the improvement of the visual range and the freeing of the hands for purposes of defence and offence may equally have played their part as catalysts

. Darwin was accused of looking to the evolution of early human ancestors through the moral codes of the 19th century Victorian society. --- # Bipedalism#Evolution of human bipedalism Bipedalism is a form of terrestrial locomotion where an animal moves by means of its two rear (or lower) limbs or legs. An animal or machine that usually moves in a bipedal manner is known as a biped /ˈbaɪpɛd/, meaning 'two feet' (from Latin bis 'double' and pes 'foot')

. Charles Darwin wrote that ""Man could not have attained his present dominant position in the world without the use of his hands, which are so admirably adapted to the act of obedience of his will"". Darwin (1871:52) and many models on bipedal origins are based on this line of thought. Gordon","According to the context, Napier argued that it is unlikely that a single factor drove the evolution of bipedalism.

"What were the three major pressures that drove the evolution of bipedalism, according to Day (1986)?","food acquisition, predator avoidance, and reproductive success","."" Sigmon (1971) demonstrated that chimpanzees exhibit bipedalism in different contexts, and one single factor should be used to explain bipedalism: preadaptation for human bipedalism. Day (1986) emphasized three major pressures that drove evolution of bipedalism: food acquisition, predator avoidance, and reproductive success. Ko (2015) stated that there are two main questions regarding bipedalism 1. Why were the earliest hominins partially bipedal? and 2

. In addition to the change in shoulder stability, changing locomotion would have increased the demand for shoulder mobility, which would have propelled the evolution of bipedalism forward. The different hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive and a number of selective forces may have acted together to lead to human bipedalism. It is important to distinguish between adaptations for bipedalism and adaptations for running, which came later still

"What is the main reason why hominins became more bipedal over time, according to the Savanna-based theory?",They were forced to adapt to life on the open savanna after leaving the trees,". Why did hominins become more bipedal over time? He argued that these questions can be answered with combination of prominent theories such as Savanna-based, Postural feeding, and Provisioning. According to the Savanna-based theory, hominines came down from the tree's branches and adapted to life on the savanna by walking erect on two feet. The theory suggests that early hominids were forced to adapt to bipedal locomotion on the open savanna after they left the trees

. There is also not only the question of why the earliest hominins were partially bipedal but also why hominins became more bipedal over time. For example, the postural feeding hypothesis describes how the earliest hominins became bipedal for the benefit of reaching food in trees while the savanna-based theory describes how the late hominins that started to settle on the ground became increasingly bipedal

Did the knuckle-walking hypothesis propose that human ancestors used quadrupedal locomotion on the savanna?,True,". One of the proposed mechanisms was the knuckle-walking hypothesis, which states that human ancestors used quadrupedal locomotion on the savanna, as evidenced by morphological characteristics found in Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus afarensis forelimbs, and that it is less parsimonious to assume that knuckle walking developed twice in genera Pan and Gorilla instead of evolving it once as synapomorphy for Pan and Gorilla before losing it in Australopithecus

. It has also been proposed that, like some modern-day apes, early hominins had undergone a knuckle-walking stage prior to adapting the back limbs for bipedality while retaining forearms capable of grasping

. Early hominines such as Ardipithecus ramidus may have possessed an arboreal type of bipedalism that later independently evolved towards knuckle-walking in chimpanzees and gorillas and towards efficient walking and running in modern humans (see figure). It is also proposed that one cause of Neanderthal extinction was a less efficient running

. Earlier fossils, such as Orrorin tugenensis, indicate bipedalism around six million years ago, around the time of the split between humans and chimpanzees indicated ","Yes, according to the context, the knuckle-walking hypothesis proposes that human ancestors used quadrupedal locomotion on the savanna.",1.0,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.0,"While the context mentions the knuckle-walking hypothesis, it is not specific enough to indicate that it was the proposed mechanism. The retrieved answer is relevant but not entirely accurate."
What was one possible advantage of bipedalism in the savanna?,"Reducing the amount of surface area of the body exposed to the sun, helping regulate body temperature",". The evolution of an orthograde posture would have been very helpful on a savanna as it would allow the ability to look over tall grasses in order to watch out for predators, or terrestrially hunt and sneak up on prey. It was also suggested in P. E. Wheeler's ""The evolution of bipedality and loss of functional body hair in hominids"", that a possible advantage of bipedalism in the savanna was reducing the amount of surface area of the body exposed to the sun, helping regulate body temperature

. It is possible that bipedalism was favored because it freed the hands for reaching and carrying food, saved energy during locomotion, enabled long-distance running and hunting, provided an enhanced field of vision, and helped avoid hyperthermia by reducing the surface area exposed to direct sun; features all advantageous for thriving in the new savanna and woodland environment created as a result of the East African Rift Valley uplift versus the previous closed forest habitat

. The fossil evidence reveals that early bipedal hominins were still adapted to climbing trees at the time they were also walking upright. It is possible that bipedalism evolved in the trees, and was later applied to ","One possible advantage of bipedalism in the savanna was reducing the amount of surface area of the body exposed to the sun, helping regulate body temperature.",1.0,0.9,0.85,0.7,0.0,"The answer is factually correct, but it is not relevant to the question. It could have been a more helpful answer if it had focused on the benefits of bipedalism in the savanna, such as its role in regulating body temperature."
What is Elizabeth Vrba's hypothesis about?,turnover pulse,". In fact, Elizabeth Vrba's turnover pulse hypothesis supports the savanna-based theory by explaining the shrinking of forested areas due to global warming and cooling, which forced animals out into the open grasslands and caused the need for hominids to acquire bipedality. Others state hominines had already achieved the bipedal adaptation that was used in the savanna

. The Romulus and Remus hypothesis, proposed by neuroscientist Andrey Vyshedskiy, seeks to address the question as to why the modern speech apparatus originated over 500,000 years before the earliest signs of modern human imagination. This hypothesis proposes that there were two phases that led to modern recursive language. The phenomenon of recursion occurs across multiple linguistic domains, arguably most prominently in syntax and morphology

. The popular science writer Elaine Morgan supported this hypothesis in her 1972 book The Descent of Woman. In it, she contrasted the theory with zoologist and ethnologist Desmond Morris's theories of sexuality, which she believed to be rooted in sexism

The passage does not provide specific evidence for this, and it is possible that the evidence is ambiguous."
What is unique about humans and orangutans when climbing on thin branches?,They both exhibit increased hip and knee extension in relation to the diameter of the branch,". Humans and orangutans are both unique to a bipedal reactive adaptation when climbing on thin branches, in which they have increased hip and knee extension in relation to the diameter of the branch, which can increase an arboreal feeding range and can be attributed to a convergent evolution of bipedalism evolving in arboreal environments

. Having long hind limbs and short forelimbs allows humans to walk upright, while orangutans and gibbons had the adaptation of longer arms to swing on branches. Apes can stand on their hindlimbs, but they cannot do so for long periods of time without getting tired. This is because their femurs are not adapted for bipedalism

. For this reason, Hunt argues that bipedalism evolved more as a terrestrial feeding posture than as a walking posture. A related study conducted by University of Birmingham, Professor Susannah Thorpe examined the most arboreal great ape, the orangutan, holding onto supporting branches in order to navigate branches that were too flexible or unstable otherwise. In more than 75 percent of observations, the orangutans used their forelimbs to stabilize themselves while navigating thinner branches

It provides a general description of their bipedal reactive adaptation but misses the specific anatomical differences in hip and knee extension that contribute to their arboreal feeding range.
What are the necessary conditions for an organism to become fossilized?,"The necessary conditions include a specific set of circumstances, such as rapid burial in sediment or ash, minimal oxygenation, and preservation from scavengers and decomposition.",". Preserved skin, salt-preserved or air-dried, can also be used in certain situations. DNA preservation is difficult because the bone fossilisation degrades and DNA is chemically modified, usually by bacteria and fungi in the soil. The best time to extract DNA from a fossil is when it is freshly out of the ground as it contains six times the DNA when compared to stored bones

. Hominine fossils found in dry grassland environments led anthropologists to believe hominines lived, slept, walked upright, and died only in those environments because no hominine fossils were found in forested areas. However, fossilization is a rare occurrence—the conditions must be just right in order for an organism that dies to become fossilized for somebody to find later, which is also a rare occurrence

. To avoid contaminating the ancient DNA, specimens are handled with gloves and stored in -20 °C immediately after being unearthed. Ensuring that the fossil sample is analyzed in a lab that has not been used for other DNA analysis could prevent contamination as well. Bones are milled to a powder and treated with a solution before the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process. Samples for DNA amplification","According to the context, the necessary conditions for an organism to become fossilized are:

What is true about the lack of hominine fossil finds in forests?,It does not necessarily mean no hominines ever died there,". The fact that no hominine fossils were found in forests does not ultimately lead to the conclusion that no hominines ever died there. The convenience of the savanna-based theory caused this point to be overlooked for over a hundred years. Some of the fossils found actually showed that there was still an adaptation to arboreal life

. About 9.5 million years ago, tropical forest in Europe was replaced by woodlands which were less suitable for great apes, and European Homininae (close to the Dryopithecini-Hominini split) appear to have migrated back to Africa where they would have diverged into Gorillini and Hominini. Plant fossils reveal that forests use to once extend ""from southern Europe, through Central Asia, and into China prior to the formation of the Himalayas""

What is unique about Little Foot's toes?,He has a divergent big toe as well as the ankle strength to walk upright.,". Human feet evolved enlarged heels. The human foot evolved as a platform to support the entire weight of the body, rather than acting as a grasping structure (like hands), as it did in early hominids. Humans therefore have smaller toes than their bipedal ancestors. This includes a non-opposable hallux, which is relocated in line with the other toes. The push off would also require all the toes to be slightly bent up. Humans have a foot arch rather than being flat footed

. For example, Lucy, the famous Australopithecus afarensis, found in Hadar in Ethiopia, which may have been forested at the time of Lucy's death, had curved fingers that would still give her the ability to grasp tree branches, but she walked bipedally. ""Little Foot"", a nearly-complete specimen of Australopithecus africanus, has a divergent big toe as well as the ankle strength to walk upright. ""Little Foot"" could grasp things using his feet like an ape, perhaps tree branches, and he was bipedal

This was progressively lost in habilines.

What is suggested to have been the original environment in which ancient human fossils were found?,Much more wet and covered in thick vegetation,".[e] Fossils of early Homo sapiens were found in Qafzeh and Es-Skhul Caves in Israel and have been dated to 80,000 to 120,000 years ago. These humans seem to have either become extinct or retreated back to Africa 70,000 to 80,000 years ago, possibly replaced by southbound Neanderthals escaping the colder regions of ice-age Europe. Hua Liu et al. analyzed autosomal microsatellite markers dating to about 56,000 years ago

. Early Eurasian Homo sapiens fossils have been found in Apidima Cave (Greece) and Misliya Cave (Israel), dated to 210,000 and 194,000–177,000 years old respectively.

What were the energy costs of quadrupedal and bipedal movements in chimpanzees according to the experiment?,very similar,". In an experiment monitoring chimpanzee metabolic rate via oxygen consumption, it was found that the quadrupedal and bipedal energy costs were very similar, implying that this transition in early ape-like ancestors would not have been very difficult or energetically costing. This increased travel efficiency is likely to have been selected for as it assisted foraging across widely dispersed resources. The postural feeding hypothesis has been recently supported by Dr

. These changes allowed for the upright gait to be overall more energy efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. The evolutionary factors that produced these changes have been the subject of several theories that correspond with environmental changes on a global scale. Human walking is about 75% less costly than both quadrupedal and bipedal walking in chimpanzees

. Some hypotheses have supported that bipedalism increased the energetic efficiency of travel and that this was an important factor in the origin of bipedal locomotion.

"According to Kevin Hunt's hypothesis, why did chimpanzees become bipedal?",To obtain food,". Kevin Hunt, a professor at Indiana University. This hypothesis asserts that chimpanzees were only bipedal when they eat.

What is one similarity between Australopithecus afarensus hand and shoulder anatomy to that of a chimpanzee?,It indicates hanging arms.,". Also, Hunt's hypotheses states that these movements coevolved with chimpanzee arm-hanging, as this movement was very effective and efficient in harvesting food. When analyzing fossil anatomy, Australopithecus afarensis has very similar features of the hand and shoulder to the chimpanzee, which indicates hanging arms. Also, the Australopithecus hip and hind limb very clearly indicate bipedalism, but these fossils also indicate very inefficient locomotive movement when compared to humans

. However, the degree of sexual dimorphism is debated due to the fragmentary nature of australopith remains. One paper finds that A. afarensis had a level of dimorphism close to modern humans. According to A. Zihlman, Australopithecus body proportions closely resemble those of bonobos (Pan paniscus), leading evolutionary biologist Jeremy Griffith to suggest that bonobos may be phenotypically similar to Australopithecus

. It is thought that A. afarensis was ancestral to both the genus Australopithecus and the genus Homo. Compared to the modern and extinct great apes, A. afarensis had reduced canines and molars, although they were still relatively larger than in modern humans.

What is a key factor that early hominids engaged in to improve offspring survivorship?,Pair-bonding,". In the face of long inter-birth intervals and low reproductive rates typical of the apes, early hominids engaged in pair-bonding that enabled greater parental effort directed towards rearing offspring.

Thus the male would leave his mate and offspring to search for food and return carrying the food in his arms walking on his legs

What is one of the human traits associated with concealed ovulation mentioned in the context?,Permanently enlarged breasts,". In addition, this model is supported by a number of modern human traits associated with concealed ovulation (permanently enlarged breasts, lack of sexual swelling) and low sperm competition (moderate sized testes, low sperm mid-piece volume) that argues against recent adaptation to a polygynous reproductive system. However, this model has been debated, as others have argued that early bipedal hominids were instead polygynous

. Facial and vocal attractiveness have been observed to change with estradiol and progesterone in pattens consistent with fertility-related increases, although some data challenge this interpretation. In general, ovulatory cycle changes are more subtle than in non-human primates, perhaps representing leakage of information on fertility and hormonal status rather than signals functioning to convey this information

There is further evidence from the same study that in fertile stages of the menstrual cycle, women also had a preference for other masculine traits such as body size, facial shape, and dominant behavior, which are indicators of both fertility and health.

What is the estimated difference in weight between Australopithecus afarensis males and females?,Nearly twice,". Among most monogamous primates, males and females are about the same size. That is sexual dimorphism is minimal, and other studies have suggested that Australopithecus afarensis males were nearly twice the weight of females. However, Lovejoy's model posits that the larger range a provisioning male would have to cover (to avoid competing with the female for resources she could attain herself) would select for increased male body size to limit predation risk

. Most species of Australopithecus were diminutive and gracile, usually standing 1.2 to 1.4 m (3 ft 11 in to 4 ft 7 in) tall. It is possible that they exhibited a considerable degree of sexual dimorphism, males being larger than females. In modern populations, males are on average a mere 15% larger than females, while in Australopithecus, males could be up to 50% larger than females by some estimates

. However, the degree of sexual dimorphism is debated due to the fragmentary nature of australopith remains. One paper finds that A. afarensis had a level of dimorphism close to modern humans. According to A. Zihlman, Australopithecus body proportions closely resemble those of bonobos (Pan paniscus), leading evolutionary biologis","According to the context, among most monogamous primates, males and females are about the same size.

What is known about the social structure of Australopithecus afarensis?,Australopithecus afarensis lived in large groups,". A member of the Australopithecus afarensis left human-like footprints on volcanic ash in Laetoli, northern Tanzania, providing strong evidence of full-time bipedalism. Australopithecus afarensis lived between 3.9 and 2.9 million years ago, and is considered one of the earliest hominins—those species that developed and comprised the lineage of Homo and Homo's closest relatives after the split from the line of the chimpanzees. It is thought that A

. It is thought that A. afarensis was ancestral to both the genus Australopithecus and the genus Homo. Compared to the modern and extinct great apes, A. afarensis had reduced canines and molars, although they were still relatively larger than in modern humans. A. afarensis also has a relatively small brain size (380–430 cm3) and a prognathic (anterior-projecting) face. Australopithecines have been found in savannah environments; they probably developed their diet to include scavenged meat

What is the reason for the reduction of the male hominid canine?,reduced inter-male aggression in a pair-bonded though group living primate,". This model is supported by the reduction (""feminization"") of the male canine teeth in early hominids such as Sahelanthropus tchadensis and Ardipithecus ramidus, which along with low body size dimorphism in Ardipithecus and Australopithecus, suggests a reduction in inter-male antagonistic behavior in early hominids

. However, while both gibbons and hominids have reduced canine sexual dimorphism, female gibbons enlarge ('masculinize') their canines so they can actively share in the defense of their home territory. Instead, the reduction of the male hominid canine is consistent with reduced inter-male aggression in a pair-bonded though group living primate. Recent studies of 4.4 million years old Ardipithecus ramidus suggest bipedalism

. Dominance has been associated with increased male mating success. Often contest competition produces anatomical weapons such as antlers or large canine teeth; however, hominids lack canine weaponry typical of other primates. Reduced canine size may be due to bipedalism and adaptations of the hand. Bipedalism is not a common trait, yet many species like the great apes stand on their hind legs when fighting, which increases power behind blows

. The","Based on the context, the reason for the reduction of the male hominid canine is reduced inter-male aggression in a pair-bonded, group-living primate.

It correctly identifies the relevant factor as reduced aggression and supports it with the absence of canine weaponry and bipedalism in hominids.
What is the possible relationship between Ardipithecus ramidus and African ape ancestors?,Ardipithecus ramidus was closely related to African-ape ancestors.,". ramidus, which lived about 4.4 million years ago during the early Pliocene, and A. kadabba, dated to approximately 5.6 million years ago (late Miocene). Initial behavioral analysis indicated that Ardipithecus could be very similar to chimpanzees; however, more recent analysis based on canine size and lack of canine sexual dimorphism indicates that Ardipithecus was characterised by reduced aggression, and that they more closely resemble bonobos

. Some analyses describe Australopithecus as being sister to Ardipithecus ramidus specifically. This means that Australopithecus is distinctly more closely related to Ardipithecus ramidus than Ardipithecus kadabba. Cladistically, then, Australopithecus (and eventually Homo sapiens) indeed emerged within the Ardipithecus lineage, and this lineage is not literally extinct. A. ramidus was named in September 1994.

What is the ancestral species for chimpanzees and bonobos according to Richard Dawkins?,Australopithecus gracile,". According to Richard Dawkins in his book ""The Ancestor's Tale"", chimps and bonobos are descended from Australopithecus gracile type species while gorillas are descended from Paranthropus. These apes may have once been bipedal, but then lost this ability when they were forced back into an arboreal habitat, presumably by those australopithecines from whom eventually evolved hominins

. Some subjects of interest include Neolithic religion, evidence for spirituality or cultic behavior in the Upper Paleolithic, and similarities in great ape behavior. Humanity's closest living relatives are common chimpanzees and bonobos. These primates share a common ancestor with humans who lived between six and eight million years ago. It is for this reason that chimpanzees and bonobos are viewed as the best available surrogate for this common ancestor

. Haeckel argued that humans were more closely related to the primates of South-east Asia and rejected Darwin's African hypothesis. In The Descent of Man, Darwin speculated that humans had descended from apes, which still had small brains but walked upright, freeing their hands for uses which favoured intelligence; he thought such apes were African: ","According to Richard Dawkins in his book ""The Ancestor's Tale"", chimps and bonobos are descended from Australopithecus gracile type species.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.5,0.9,"The LLM's answer provides the correct species, but it is not as accurate in terms of its relevance and context utilization."
What is proposed to be one cause of Neanderthal extinction?,A less efficient running,". However, the discovery of a Neanderthal Y-chromosome by Mendez et al. was tempered by a 2016 study that suggests the extinction of Neanderthal patrilineages, as the lineage inferred from the Neanderthal sequence is outside of the range of contemporary human genetic variation. Questions of geographical origin would become part of the debate on Neanderthal evolution from Homo erectus

. Migrations and geographical isolation notwithstanding, the three descendant groups of Homo heidelbergensis later met and interbred. Archaeological research suggests that as prehistoric humans swept across Europe 45,000 years ago, Neanderthals went extinct. Even so, there is evidence of interbreeding between the two groups as humans expanded their presence in the continent. While prehistoric humans carried 3–6% Neanderthal DNA, modern humans have only about 2%

. The anatomically modern humans known as the Cro-Magnons, with widespread trade networks, superior technology and bodies likely better suited to running, would eventually completely displace the Neanderthals, whose last refuge was in the Iberian Peninsula. Neanderthals disappeared about 40,000 years ago. From the extent of linkage disequilibr","According to the context, one cause of Neanderthal extinction is not explicitly proposed.

What was one of the central elements of the general defense strategy of early hominids?,Bipedalism,". Joseph Jordania from the University of Melbourne recently (2011) suggested that bipedalism was one of the central elements of the general defense strategy of early hominids, based on aposematism, or warning display and intimidation of potential predators and competitors with exaggerated visual and audio signals. According to this model, hominids were trying to stay as visible and as loud as possible all the time

. Hominin hands are adapted for gripping tools or hurling objects like stones. Bipedalism and utilizing handheld objects such as weapons may have aided early hominins in contest competition, reducing sexual selection pressures of maintaining large canine teeth. Several other traits in human males may have been selected for contest competition. Males exhibit a more robust face compared to females

. This model is supported by the reduction (""feminization"") of the male canine teeth in early hominids such as Sahelanthropus tchadensis and Ardipithecus ramidus, which along with low body size dimorphism in Ardipithecus and Australopithecus, suggests a reduction in inter-male antagonistic behavior in early hominids

What is one of the morphological developments employed to achieve a goal?,upright bipedal posture,". ""Grammaticalization"" is a continuous historical process in which free-standing words develop into grammatical appendages, while these in turn become ever more specialized and grammatical. An initially ""incorrect"" usage, in becoming accepted, leads to unforeseen consequences, triggering knock-on effects and extended sequences of change. Paradoxically, grammar evolves because, in the final analysis, humans care less about grammatical niceties than about making themselves understood

. Several morphological and behavioral developments were employed to achieve this goal: upright bipedal posture, longer legs, long tightly coiled hair on the top of the head, body painting, threatening synchronous body movements, loud voice and extremely loud rhythmic singing/stomping/drumming on external subjects

. They want to know what the speaker has in mind. Grammaticalisation is essentially based on metaphor. To outlaw its use would be to stop grammar from evolving and, by the same token, to exclude all possibility of expressing abstract thought

What are some features often employed by aposematic species to advertise their non-profitability for potential predators?,Slow locomotion and strong body odor,". Slow locomotion and strong body odor (both characteristic for hominids and humans) are other features often employed by aposematic species to advertise their non-profitability for potential predators. There are a variety of ideas which promote a specific change in behaviour as the key driver for the evolution of hominid bipedalism

. Joseph Jordania from the University of Melbourne recently (2011) suggested that bipedalism was one of the central elements of the general defense strategy of early hominids, based on aposematism, or warning display and intimidation of potential predators and competitors with exaggerated visual and audio signals. According to this model, hominids were trying to stay as visible and as loud as possible all the time

. Advocates of this school of thought point out that words are cheap. Should an especially clever nonhuman ape, or even a group of articulate nonhuman apes, try to use words in the wild, they would carry no conviction. The primate vocalizations that do carry conviction—those they actually use—are unlike words, in that they are emotionally expressive, intrinsically meaningful, and reliable because they are relatively costly and hard to fake

What has been suggested as an initial incentive for male phallic display and increased sexual signaling in upright female posture?,Male phallic display,".

. Thus it has been suggested the rounded female breasts are signals of fertility. Richard Dawkins has speculated that the loss of the penis bone in humans, when it is present in other primates, may be due to sexual selection by females looking for a clear sign of good health in prospective mates.

What is one proposed advantage of bipedalism according to Dr. Peter Wheeler?,a reduction in heat gain and help with heat dissipation,". Dr. Peter Wheeler, a professor of evolutionary biology, proposes that bipedalism raises the amount of body surface area higher above the ground which results in a reduction in heat gain and helps heat dissipation. When a hominid is higher above the ground, the organism accesses more favorable wind speeds and temperatures. During heat seasons, greater wind flow results in a higher heat loss, which makes the organism more comfortable

. Only after the more demanding posture was enabled by changes in the nervous system, could advantages of bipedal over quadrupedal locomotion be utilized, including better scanning of the environment, carrying food and infants, simultaneous upper extremity movements and observation of the environment, limitless manipulation of objects with upper extremities, and less space for rotating around the Z-axis

. Nonetheless, it remains a matter of controversy as to how bipedalism first emerged. The advantages of bipedalism were that it left the hands free to grasp objects (e.g., carry food and young), and allowed the eyes to look over tall grasses for possible food sources or predators, but it is also argued that these advantages were not significant enough","According to Dr. Peter Wheeler, one proposed advantage of bipedalism is that it raises the amount of body surface area higher above the ground, resulting in a reduction in heat gain and helping with heat dissipation.",1.0,1.0,0.95,0.8,0.9,"The LLM correctly identifies the ground truth answer as the proposed advantage of bipedalism, which is that it raises the amount of body surface area higher above the ground, resulting in a reduction in heat gain and helping with heat dissipation."
What is the main difference between vertical posture and quadrupedalism in terms of sun exposure?,Quadrupedalism exposes more of the body to direct sunlight compared to a vertical posture.,". Walking upright reduces the amount of direct sun exposure and radiation in comparison to being a quadruped which have more body surface on top for the sun to hit. Increased capabilities of postural/locomotor neural control is hypothesis suggesting that the transition from quadrupedal to habitual upright bipedal locomotion was caused by qualitative changes in the nervous system that allowed controlling the more demanding type of posture/locomotion

. Also, Wheeler explains that a vertical posture minimizes the direct exposure to the sun whereas quadrupedalism exposes more of the body to direct exposure. Analysis and interpretations of Ardipithecus reveal that this hypothesis needs modification to consider that the forest and woodland environmental preadaptation of early-stage hominid bipedalism preceded further refinement of bipedalism by the pressure of natural selection

"Who wrote that 'Man could not have attained his present dominant position in the world without the use of his hands, which are so admirably adapted to the act of obedience of his will'?",Charles Darwin,". Charles Darwin wrote that ""Man could not have attained his present dominant position in the world without the use of his hands, which are so admirably adapted to the act of obedience of his will"". Darwin (1871:52) and many models on bipedal origins are based on this line of thought.

What was found in ancient times that the discovery of stone tools chronologically precludes as a driving force of human evolution?,Bipedalism,". This stone-tools theory is very unlikely, as though ancient humans were known to hunt, the discovery of tools was not discovered for thousands of years after the origin of bipedalism, chronologically precluding it from being a driving force of evolution. (Wooden tools and spears fossilize poorly and therefore it is difficult to make a judgment about their potential usage

. Researchers have suggested that early hominins were thus under evolutionary pressure to increase their capacity to create and use tools. Precisely when early humans started to use tools is difficult to determine, because the more primitive these tools are (for example, sharp-edged stones) the more difficult it is to decide whether they are natural objects or human artifacts. There is some evidence that the australopithecines (4 Ma) may have used broken bones as tools, but this is debated

What is the phenomenon that has led to the idea that the origin of human bipedalism may have been influenced by waterside environments?,The observation that large primates switch to bipedal locomotion in waist deep water,".) The observation that large primates, including especially the great apes, that predominantly move quadrupedally on dry land, tend to switch to bipedal locomotion in waist deep water, has led to the idea that the origin of human bipedalism may have been influenced by waterside environments

. Other theories have been proposed that suggest wading and the exploitation of aquatic food sources (providing essential nutrients for human brain evolution or critical fallback foods) may have exerted evolutionary pressures on human ancestors promoting adaptations which later assisted full-time bipedalism.

. Others, however, have sought to promote wading as a factor in the origin of human bipedalism without referring to further (""aquatic ape"" related) factors. Since 2000 Carsten Niemitz has published a series of papers and a book on a variant of the wading hypothesis, which he calls the ""amphibian generalist theory"" (German: Amphibische Generalistentheorie)

. He stated: ""The postulation of an aquatic mode of life during an early stage of human evolution is a tenable hypothesis, for which further inquiry may produce additional supporting evidence."" He later abandoned the concept.

Since 2000 Carsten Niemitz has published a series of papers and a book on a variant of the wading hypothesis, which he calls the ""amphibian generalist theory"" (German: Amphibische Generalistentheorie)

. The 1936 book The Comparative Anatomy of the Nervous System of Vertebrates Including Man by the Dutch neurologist C.U. Ariëns Kappers (first published in German in 1921) was a landmark publication in the field. Following the Evolutionary Synthesis, the study of comparative neuroanatomy was conducted with an evolutionary view, and modern studies incorporate developmental genetics. It is now accepted that phylogenetic changes occur independently between species over time and can not be linear

. For example, Kieran McNulty covers the potential utilities and constraints of using incomplete fossil taxa to examine longitudinal development in Australopithecus africanis. Many studies on development have been human-specific. In his 2011 paper, Bernard Crespi focused on adaptation and genomic conflict in childhood diseases. He considers","According to the context, Carsten Niemitz has published a series of papers and a book on the ""amphibian generalist theory"" (German: Amphibische Generalistentheorie).",0.8,0.6,0.7,0.4,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the author's name as the ground truth, but its relevance and similarity scores are lower due to a lack of specific details about the work."
What is one theory about how aquatic food sources may have influenced human brain evolution?,Providing essential nutrients,". Other theories have been proposed that suggest wading and the exploitation of aquatic food sources (providing essential nutrients for human brain evolution or critical fallback foods) may have exerted evolutionary pressures on human ancestors promoting adaptations which later assisted full-time bipedalism. It has also been thought that consistent water-based food sources had developed early hominid dependency and facilitated dispersal along seas and rivers

. Cunnane, Stewart, Crawford, and colleagues published works arguing a correlation between aquatic diet and human brain evolution in their ""shore-based diet scenario"", acknowledging the Hardy/Morgan's thesis as a foundation work of their model. As evidence, they describe health problems in landlocked communities, such as cretinism in the Alps and goitre in parts of Africa due to salt-derived iodine deficiency, and state that inland habitats cannot naturally meet human iodide requirements

. Evidence supports aquatic food consumption in Homo as early as the Pliocene, but its linkage to brain evolution remains controversial. Further, there is no evidence that humans ate fish in significant amounts earlier than tens to hundreds o","According to the context, one theory is that aquatic diet provided essential nutrients for human brain evolution or served as critical fallback foods, which exerted evolutionary pressures on human ancestors promoting adaptations that later assisted full-time bipedalism.",0.8,0.9,0.7,0.8,0.7,"The answer is factually correct, but it lacks depth and does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the theory."
What is the term for the problem that occurs when the increase in brain size and bipedalism leads to difficult childbirth?,Obstetrical dilemma,". Prehistoric fossil records show that early hominins first developed bipedalism before being followed by an increase in brain size. The consequences of these two changes in particular resulted in painful and difficult labor due to the increased favor of a narrow pelvis for bipedalism being countered by larger heads passing through the constricted birth canal. This phenomenon is commonly known as the obstetrical dilemma

. The result of this is that there is greater difficulty in birthing for hominins in general, let alone to be doing it by oneself. Bipedal movement occurs in a number of ways and requires many mechanical and neurological adaptations. Some of these are described below. Energy-efficient means of standing bipedally involve constant adjustment of balance, and of course these must avoid overcorrection

. The shortening of the pelvis and smaller birth canal evolved as a requirement for bipedalism and had significant effects on the process of human birth, which is much more difficult in modern humans than in other primates. During human birth, because of the variation in size of the pelvic region, the fetal head must be in a transverse position (compared to the mother) du","The term for the problem that occurs when the increase in brain size and bipedalism leads to difficult childbirth is the ""obstetrical dilemma"".",1.0,1.0,0.8,0.7,0.0,The answer correctly identifies the obstetrical dilemma as a problem associated with brain size and bipedalism.
What is one reason why isolated birth appears to be rare and avoided cross-culturally?,The narrowing of the hips and the change in the pelvic angle caused a discrepancy in the ratio of the size of the head to the birth canal.,". Non-human primates habitually deliver their young on their own, but the same cannot be said for modern-day humans. Isolated birth appears to be rare and actively avoided cross-culturally, even if birthing methods may differ between said cultures. This is due to the fact that the narrowing of the hips and the change in the pelvic angle caused a discrepancy in the ratio of the size of the head to the birth canal

. Paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner of the Smithsonian Institution noted that cultural factors could play a role in the widely different rates of C-sections across the developed and developing worlds. Daghni Rajasingam of the Royal College of Obstetricians observed that the increasing rates of diabetes and obesity among women of reproductive age also boost the demand for C-sections

Additionally, the answer is not faithful to the context, as it suggests that isolated birth is always avoided cross-culturally, which is not correct."
What is one of the challenges faced by hominins when birthing?,Greater difficulty in birthing,". Prehistoric fossil records show that early hominins first developed bipedalism before being followed by an increase in brain size.

What would happen to shoulder stability with the evolution of bipedalism?,Shoulder stability would decrease,". The difficulties associated with simple standing in upright humans are highlighted by the greatly increased risk of falling present in the elderly, even with minimal reductions in control system effectiveness. Shoulder stability would decrease with the evolution of bipedalism. Shoulder mobility would increase because the need for a stable shoulder is only present in arboreal habitats. Shoulder mobility would support suspensory locomotion behaviors which are present in human bipedalism

. In addition to the change in shoulder stability, changing locomotion would have increased the demand for shoulder mobility, which would have propelled the evolution of bipedalism forward. The different hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive and a number of selective forces may have acted together to lead to human bipedalism. It is important to distinguish between adaptations for bipedalism and adaptations for running, which came later still

. This dimorphism has been seen as an evolutionary adaptation of females to bear lumbar load better during pregnancy, an adaptation that non-bipedal primates would not need to make. Adapting bipedalism would have required less shoulder stability, w","According to the context, shoulder stability would decrease with the evolution of bipedalism.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.9,"The context is somewhat relevant, but the answer is not accurate. The passage focuses on simple standing in upright humans, not bipedalism, and does not provide any specific information about shoulder stability."
What is a characteristic unique to hominins that allows them to move bipedally without using a bent-hip-bent-knee (BHBK) gait?,The spinal curvature humans have,". The forelimbs are freed from weight-bearing requirements, which makes the shoulder a place of evidence for the evolution of bipedalism. Unlike non-human apes that are able to practice bipedality such as Pan and Gorilla, hominins have the ability to move bipedally without the utilization of a bent-hip-bent-knee (BHBK) gait, which requires the engagement of both the hip and the knee joints. This human ability to walk is made possible by the spinal curvature humans have that non-human apes do not

. Early hominines such as Ardipithecus ramidus may have possessed an arboreal type of bipedalism that later independently evolved towards knuckle-walking in chimpanzees and gorillas and towards efficient walking and running in modern humans (see figure). It is also proposed that one cause of Neanderthal extinction was a less efficient running

. Other significant morphological changes included the evolution of a power and precision grip, a change first occurring in H. erectus. Bipedalism (walking on two legs) is the basic adaptation of the hominid and is considered the main cause behind a suite of skeletal changes shared by all bipedal hominids.

What is characterized by an 'inverted pendulum' movement?,Walking,". Rather, walking is characterized by an ""inverted pendulum"" movement in which the center of gravity vaults over a stiff leg with each step. Force plates can be used to quantify the whole-body kinetic & potential energy, with walking displaying an out-of-phase relationship indicating exchange between the two. This model applies to all walking organisms regardless of the number of legs, and thus bipedal locomotion does not differ in terms of whole-body kinetics

. The degree of knee extension (the angle between the thigh and shank in a walking cycle) has decreased. The changing pattern of the knee joint angle of humans shows a small extension peak, called the ""double knee action,"" in the midstance phase. Double knee action decreases energy lost by vertical movement of the center of gravity

. This article therefore avoids the terms ""facultative"" and ""obligate"", and focuses on the range of styles of locomotion normally used by various groups of animals. Normal humans may be considered ""obligate"" bipeds because the alternatives are very uncomfortable and usually only resorted to when walking is impossible. There are a number of states of movement commonly associated with bipedalism

.","According to the context, walking is characterized by an ""inverted pendulum"" movement in which the center of gravity vaults over a stiff leg with each step.",0.5,0.3,0.7,0.1,0.0,The LLM's answer provides a correct description of walking but lacks the nuance and context of the actual movement described in the context.
What is one of the post-cranial changes that early hominins underwent to adapt to bipedality?,Having longer hindlimbs proportional to the forelimbs,". Other significant morphological changes included the evolution of a power and precision grip, a change first occurring in H. erectus. Bipedalism (walking on two legs) is the basic adaptation of the hominid and is considered the main cause behind a suite of skeletal changes shared by all bipedal hominids. The earliest hominin, of presumably primitive bipedalism, is considered to be either Sahelanthropus or Orrorin, both of which arose some 6 to 7 million years ago

. There is also not only the question of why the earliest hominins were partially bipedal but also why hominins became more bipedal over time. For example, the postural feeding hypothesis describes how the earliest hominins became bipedal for the benefit of reaching food in trees while the savanna-based theory describes how the late hominins that started to settle on the ground became increasingly bipedal

. The fossil evidence reveals that early bipedal hominins were still adapted to climbing trees at the time they were also walking upright. It is possible that bipedalism evolved in the trees, and was later applied to the savanna as a vestigial trait

. Why did hominins become more bipedal over time? He argued that the","According to the context, one of the significant morphological changes that occurred in early hominins was the evolution of a power and precision grip, which first appeared in H. erectus.",0.75,0.85,0.9,0.7,0.0,"The LLM's answer is partially correct, but it misses the key point about the evolution of a power and precision grip as a significant morphological change that early hominins underwent to adapt to bipedality."
What type of movement is characterized by kinetic and potential energy being in phase?,Spring-mass movement,". Rather, walking is characterized by an ""inverted pendulum"" movement in which the center of gravity vaults over a stiff leg with each step. Force plates can be used to quantify the whole-body kinetic & potential energy, with walking displaying an out-of-phase relationship indicating exchange between the two. This model applies to all walking organisms regardless of the number of legs, and thus bipedal locomotion does not differ in terms of whole-body kinetics

. Additionally, having longer limbs is more energy-efficient, since longer limbs mean that overall muscle strain is lessened. Better energy efficiency, in turn, means higher endurance, particularly when running long distances. Running is characterized by a spring-mass movement. Kinetic and potential energy are in phase, and the energy is stored & released from a spring-like limb during foot contact, achieved by the plantar arch and the Achilles tendon in the foot and leg, respectively

. Human runners differ from quadrupeds in that while running they employ several phase-locked patterns (4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 5:2, and 3:2), although a 2:1 coupling ratio appears to be favored. Even though the evolution of bipedal gait has reduc","According to the context, running is characterized by a spring-mass movement where kinetic and potential energy are in phase.",0.2,0.5,0.7,0.1,0.8,The LLM's answer is partially correct but lacks the necessary details to accurately describe the type of movement. It conflates the concepts of kinetic and potential energy and misses the specific characteristics of a spring-mass movement such as phase relationship between these energies.
What is a characteristic shared between animals with more limbs and bipedalism?,"Strong leg muscles, particularly in the thighs",". Again, the whole-body kinetics are similar to animals with more limbs. Bipedalism requires strong leg muscles, particularly in the thighs. Contrast in domesticated poultry the well muscled legs, against the small and bony wings. Likewise in humans, the quadriceps and hamstring muscles of the thigh are both so crucial to bipedal activities that each alone is much larger than the well-developed biceps of the arms

. Some animals commonly stand on their hind legs to reach food, keep watch, threaten a competitor or predator, or pose in courtship, but do not move bipedally. The word is derived from the Latin words bi(s) 'two' and ped- 'foot', as contrasted with quadruped 'four feet'. Limited and exclusive bipedalism can offer a species several advantages

. Bipedalism raises the head; this allows a greater field of vision with improved detection of distant dangers or resources, access to deeper water for wading animals and allows the animals to reach higher food sources with their mouths. While upright, non-locomotory limbs become free for other uses, including manipulation (in primates and rodents), flight (in birds), digging (in the giant pangolin), combat (in bears, great apes and ","According to the context, a characteristic shared between animals with more limbs and bipedalism is that both require strong leg muscles, particularly in the thighs.",0.7,0.8,0.5,0.7,0.0,"The LLM's answer is somewhat relevant, but it fails to capture the nuance of the context. The context mentions that bipedalism requires strong leg muscles, but it does not specify the exact location or the degree of strength required."
What is the typical ratio of strides to breaths for quadrupedal species?,1:1,". In addition to the leg muscles, the increased size of the gluteus maximus in humans is an important adaptation as it provides support and stability to the trunk and lessens the amount of stress on the joints when running. Quadrupeds, have more restrictive breathing respire while moving than do bipedal humans. ""Quadrupedal species normally synchronize the locomotor and respiratory cycles at a constant ratio of 1:1 (strides per breath) in both the trot and gallop

. Human runners differ from quadrupeds in that while running they employ several phase-locked patterns (4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 5:2, and 3:2), although a 2:1 coupling ratio appears to be favored. Even though the evolution of bipedal gait has reduced the mechanical constraints on respiration in man, thereby permitting greater flexibility in breathing pattern, it has seemingly not eliminated the need for the synchronization of respiration and body motion during sustained running

. The maximum bipedal speed appears slower than the maximum speed of quadrupedal movement with a flexible backbone – both the ostrich and the red kangaroo can reach speeds of 70 km/h (43 mph), while the cheetah can exceed 100 km/h (62 mph). Even though","According to the context, the typical ratio of strides to breaths for quadrupedal species is 1:1.",1.0,1.0,1,0.5,1.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the ratio of strides to breaths as 1:1, but it lacks contextual information and fails to mention the specific adaptations in quadrupedal species such as the gluteus maximus."
What is the most favored phase-locked coupling ratio used by human runners?,2:1,". Human runners differ from quadrupeds in that while running they employ several phase-locked patterns (4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 5:2, and 3:2), although a 2:1 coupling ratio appears to be favored.

What percentage of energy input is used by the modern human brain?,20%,". Paleontology has yet to explain the expansion of this organ over millions of years despite being extremely demanding in terms of energy consumption. The brain of a modern human consumes, on average, about 13 watts (260 kilocalories per day), a fifth of the body's resting power consumption. Increased tool use would allow hunting for energy-rich meat products, and would enable processing more energy-rich plant products

."" Respiration through bipedality means that there is better breath control in bipeds, which can be associated with brain growth. The modern brain utilizes approximately 20% of energy input gained through breathing and eating, as opposed to species like chimpanzees who use up twice as much energy as humans for the same amount of movement. This excess energy, leading to brain growth, also leads to the development of verbal communication

. This is despite access to many non-thermal processing, like grinding, pounding or heating to 48 °C. (118 °F). With approximately 86 billion neurons in the human brain and 60–70 kg body mass, an exclusively raw diet close to that of what extant primates have would be not viable as, when modelled, it is argued that it would require a","According to the context, ""The modern brain utilizes approximately 20% of energy input gained through breathing and eating...""

What was challenging for constructing bipedal robots in the 20th century?,"Robot locomotion involved only wheels, treads, or multiple legs.",". This is because breath control means that the muscles associated with breathing can be manipulated into creating sounds. This means that the onset of bipedality, leading to more efficient breathing, may be related to the origin of verbal language. For nearly the whole of the 20th century, bipedal robots were very difficult to construct and robot locomotion involved only wheels, treads, or multiple legs. Recent cheap and compact computing power has made two-legged robots more feasible

. Only after the more demanding posture was enabled by changes in the nervous system, could advantages of bipedal over quadrupedal locomotion be utilized, including better scanning of the environment, carrying food and infants, simultaneous upper extremity movements and observation of the environment, limitless manipulation of objects with upper extremities, and less space for rotating around the Z-axis

Recently, spurred by the success of creating a fully passive, un-powered bipedal walking robot, those working on such machines have begun using principles gleaned from the study of human and animal locomotion, which often relies on passive mechanisms to minimize power consumption

. Bipedality in kangaroo rats has been hypothesized to improve locomotor performance, [clarification needed] which could aid in escaping from predators. Zoologists often label behaviors, including bipedalism, as ""facultative"" (i.e. optional) or ""obligate"" (the animal has no reasonable alternative). Even this distinction is not completely clear-cut — for example, humans other than infants normally walk and run in biped fashion, but almost all can crawl on hands and knees when necessary

What is the approximate age when bipedalism began in primates?,approximately four million years ago,". The evolution of human bipedalism began in primates about four million years ago, or as early as seven million years ago with Sahelanthropus or about 12 million years ago with Danuvius guggenmosi. One hypothesis for human bipedalism is that it evolved as a result of differentially successful survival from carrying food to share with group members, although there are alternative hypotheses. Injured chimpanzees and bonobos have been capable of sustained bipedalism

. --- # Human skeletal changes due to bipedalism The evolution of human bipedalism, which began in primates approximately four million years ago, or as early as seven million years ago with Sahelanthropus, or approximately twelve million years ago with Danuvius guggenmosi, has led to morphological alterations to the human skeleton including changes to the arrangement, shape, and size of the bones of the foot, hip, knee, leg, and the vertebral column

How much more energy efficient is human walking compared to quadrupedal and bipedal walking in chimpanzees?,75%,". These changes allowed for the upright gait to be overall more energy efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. The evolutionary factors that produced these changes have been the subject of several theories that correspond with environmental changes on a global scale. Human walking is about 75% less costly than both quadrupedal and bipedal walking in chimpanzees

. Some hypotheses have supported that bipedalism increased the energetic efficiency of travel and that this was an important factor in the origin of bipedal locomotion. Humans save more energy than quadrupeds when walking but not when running. Human running is 75% less efficient than walking. A 1980 study reported that walking in living hominin bipeds is noticeably more efficient than walking in living hominin quadrupeds, but the costs of quadrupedal and bipedal travel are the same

.

What characteristic do humans' feet have that differs from those of their bipedal ancestors?,Smaller toes,". Human feet evolved enlarged heels. The human foot evolved as a platform to support the entire weight of the body, rather than acting as a grasping structure (like hands), as it did in early hominids. Humans therefore have smaller toes than their bipedal ancestors. This includes a non-opposable hallux, which is relocated in line with the other toes. The push off would also require all the toes to be slightly bent up. Humans have a foot arch rather than being flat footed

. Another change is the shape of the big toe. Recent studies suggest that australopithecines still lived part of the time in trees as a result of maintaining a grasping big toe. This was progressively lost in habilines. Anatomically, the evolution of bipedalism has been accompanied by a large number of skeletal changes, not just to the legs and pelvis, but also to the vertebral column, feet and ankles, and skull

. Earlier fossils, such as Orrorin tugenensis, indicate bipedalism around six million years ago, around the time of the split between humans and chimpanzees indicated by genetic studies. This suggests that erect, straight-legged walking originated as an adaptation to tree-dwelling. Major changes to the pe","According to the context, humans' feet have smaller toes than their bipedal ancestors.",1.0,0.9,0.8,0.7,0.0,"The answer provides a correct description of how humans' feet have evolved to be smaller than those of their bipedal ancestors, specifically through the development of enlarged heels."
What is transmitted from the heel in human locomotion compared to non-human hominids?,Weight,". When non-human hominids walk upright, weight is transmitted from the heel, along the outside of the foot, and then through the middle toes while a human foot transmits weight from the heel, along the outside of the foot, across the ball of the foot and finally through the big toe. This transference of weight contributes to energy conservation during locomotion. The muscles that work along with the hallux has evolved to provide efficient push off

. The plantaris muscle in the foot which helped our ancestors grab and manipulate objects like chimps do, has adapted to its new evolutionary role appropriately, becoming so underdeveloped that it cannot grip or grab anything, the foot has grown more elongated as a result and now 9% of humans are born without it. Homo sapiens benefitted by becoming a better defender and hunter. An increase in running as a hunting and survival activity was perhaps fundamental to this development

While it correctly identifies the direction of weight transmission from the heel to the toes, it is not accurate about the specific location of the transfer points in non-human hominids."
What is the purpose of the stiffening of the human arch?,To provide efficient push-off,". The long arch has also evolved to provide efficient push-off. The stiffening of the arch would be required of an upward gait, all considered that modern bipedalism does not include grasping of tree branches, which also explains the hallux evolving to line up with the rest of the toes. Human knee joints are enlarged for the same reason as the hip – to better support an increased amount of body weight

. Specifically, he posits that adaptations such as a flattening face and the development of the nuchal ligament promote improved head balance for cranial stabilization during extended periods of running. Compared to Australopithecus fossil skeletons, selection for walking by itself would not develop some of these proposed ""endurance running"" derived traits: The derived longer hindlimb was already present in Australopithecus along with evidence for foot bones with a stiff arch

. They also have a shorter, broader shape. This alteration in shape brought the vertebral column closer to the hip joint, providing a stable base for support of the trunk while walking upright. Because bipedal walking requires humans to balance on a relatively unstable ball and socket joint, the placement of th","According to the context, the stiffening of the human arch would be required for an upward gait. This suggests that the stiffening serves to provide efficient push-off during walking or running.",1.0,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies that the stiffening of the human arch is required for efficient push-off during an upward gait, but it provides an inaccurate description of the purpose (providing efficient push-off during walking or running)."
What is the name of the small extension peak in the knee joint angle that occurs in the midstance phase?,Double knee action,". The degree of knee extension (the angle between the thigh and shank in a walking cycle) has decreased. The changing pattern of the knee joint angle of humans shows a small extension peak, called the ""double knee action,"" in the midstance phase. Double knee action decreases energy lost by vertical movement of the center of gravity

. The femur evolved into a slightly more angular position to move the center of gravity toward the geometric center of the body. The knee and ankle joints became increasingly robust to better support increased weight. To support the increased weight on each vertebra in the upright position, the human vertebral column became S-shaped and the lumbar vertebrae became shorter and wider. In the feet the big toe moved into alignment with the other toes to help in forward locomotion

. Balance of the whole vertebral column over the hip joints is a major contribution for efficient bipedalism. The degree of body erection (the angle of body incline to a vertical line in a walking cycle) is significantly smaller to conserve energy. The Angle of Sacral Incidence was a concept developed by G. Duval-Beaupère and his team at the University of René Descartes

. The sac","According to the context, the answer is:

""Double knee action""",0.8,0.8,0.9,0.7,0.9,The LLM's answer is correct but provides a generic description of the double knee action rather than the specific name of the peak in the knee joint angle.
What is the source of the push that drives human walking?,The leg muscles acting at the ankle,". When non-human hominids walk upright, weight is transmitted from the heel, along the outside of the foot, and then through the middle toes while a human foot transmits weight from the heel, along the outside of the foot, across the ball of the foot and finally through the big toe. This transference of weight contributes to energy conservation during locomotion. The muscles that work along with the hallux has evolved to provide efficient push off

. Rather, walking is characterized by an ""inverted pendulum"" movement in which the center of gravity vaults over a stiff leg with each step. Force plates can be used to quantify the whole-body kinetic & potential energy, with walking displaying an out-of-phase relationship indicating exchange between the two. This model applies to all walking organisms regardless of the number of legs, and thus bipedal locomotion does not differ in terms of whole-body kinetics

. Humans walk with their knees kept straight and the thighs bent inward so that the knees are almost directly under the body, rather than out to the side, as is the case in ancestral hominids. This type of gait also aids balance. An increase in leg length since the evolution of bi","According to the context, the muscles that work along with the hallux (big toe) have evolved to provide efficient push-off during human walking.",0.9,0.8,0.95,0.7,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies the leg muscles involved in push-off, but the context could provide more specific details about the contribution of the hallux and other toes in the process."
What is the consequence of a longer leg in humans?,Humans do not need to use muscle to swing the other leg forward for the next step,". A longer leg allows the use of the natural swing of the limb so that, when walking, humans do not need to use muscle to swing the other leg forward for the next step. As a consequence, since the human forelimbs are not needed for locomotion, they are instead optimized for carrying, holding, and manipulating objects with great precision. This results in decreased strength in the forelimbs relative to body size for humans compared to apes

. In humans, walking is composed of several separate processes: Early hominins underwent post-cranial changes in order to better adapt to bipedality, especially running. One of these changes is having longer hindlimbs proportional to the forelimbs and their effects. As previously mentioned, longer hindlimbs assist in thermoregulation by reducing the total surface area exposed to direct sunlight while simultaneously allowing for more space for cooling winds

. Additionally, having longer limbs is more energy-efficient, since longer limbs mean that overall muscle strain is lessened. Better energy efficiency, in turn, means higher endurance, particularly when running long distances. Running is characterized by a spring-mass movement. Kinetic and pot","According to the context, the consequence of a longer leg in humans is that it allows for more energy efficiency, lessening overall muscle strain, which results in higher endurance, particularly when running long distances.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.6,0.0,"The LLM correctly identifies that a longer leg allows for more energy efficiency, reducing muscle strain and increasing endurance, but it could be more specific about the specific physiological benefits for humans."
What is a characteristic that apes lack in terms of bipedalism?,Their femurs are not adapted for bipedalism,". The primate version of bipedalism is unusual because the back is close to upright (completely upright in humans), and the tail may be absent entirely. Many primates can stand upright on their hind legs without any support. Chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, gibbons and baboons exhibit forms of bipedalism. On the ground sifakas move like all indrids with bipedal sideways hopping movements of the hind legs, holding their forelimbs up for balance

. The forelimbs are freed from weight-bearing requirements, which makes the shoulder a place of evidence for the evolution of bipedalism. Unlike non-human apes that are able to practice bipedality such as Pan and Gorilla, hominins have the ability to move bipedally without the utilization of a bent-hip-bent-knee (BHBK) gait, which requires the engagement of both the hip and the knee joints. This human ability to walk is made possible by the spinal curvature humans have that non-human apes do not

. It is thus possible that bipedalism evolved very early in homininae and was reduced in chimpanzee and gorilla when they became more specialized. Other recent studies of the foot structure of Ardipithecus ramidus suggest that the species was closely","According to the context, a characteristic that apes (specifically non-human apes such as Pan and Gorilla) lack in terms of bipedalism is the ability to move bipedally without utilizing a bent-hip-bent-knee (BHBK) gait.",1.0,0.8,0.7,0.5,0.9,The LLM correctly identifies that the ability to move bipedally is a characteristic that apes lack in comparison to humans.
What is the primary function of the gluteus maximus muscle in humans?,It plays a major role in walking,". This muscle is much smaller in chimps, which shows that it has an important role in bipedalism. When humans run, our upright posture tends to flex forward as each foot strikes the ground creating momentum forward. The gluteus muscle helps to prevent the upper trunk of the body from ""pitching forward"" or falling over. Modern human hip joints are larger than in quadrupedal ancestral species to better support the greater amount of body weight passing through them

. Apes have vertical femurs, while humans have femurs that are slightly angled medially from the hip to the knee, thus making human knees closer together and under the body's center of gravity. This adaptation lets humans lock their knees and stand up straight for long periods of time without much effort from muscles. The gluteus maximus became a major role in walking and is one of the largest muscles in humans

. Increased muscle activity seems related to the speed and intensity of the movement rather than the gait itself. The data suggests that the large size of the gluteus maximus reflects multiple roles during rapid and powerful movements rather than a specific adaptation to submaximal endurance running

. Gluteus maxi","Based on the context, the primary function of the gluteus maximus muscle in humans is to help prevent the upper trunk of the body from ""pitching forward"" or falling over when running, by stabilizing and keeping upright posture.",0.9,0.8,0.9,0.7,0.0,"The LLM's answer is generally correct, but it could be improved by providing a more specific example of how the gluteus maximus muscle helps prevent the upper trunk from pitching forward when running."
What is the primary function of the gluteus muscle?,To prevent the upper trunk of the body from 'pitching forward' or falling over,". This muscle is much smaller in chimps, which shows that it has an important role in bipedalism. When humans run, our upright posture tends to flex forward as each foot strikes the ground creating momentum forward. The gluteus muscle helps to prevent the upper trunk of the body from ""pitching forward"" or falling over. Modern human hip joints are larger than in quadrupedal ancestral species to better support the greater amount of body weight passing through them

. The conversion to full-time bipedalism in our distant ancestors is the main argument for the adaptations our muscle structure and function have made. By having to center the force of gravity on two feet, the human thigh bone developed an inward slope down to the knee which may have allowed their gluteal abductors to adapt to the stress and build the necessary muscle. This allows the human to manage their balance on a single foot and when “in-stride” during walking

What is one adaptation that allowed humans to walk upright more efficiently?,The placement of the vertebral column closer to the hip joint,". The fossil evidence reveals that early bipedal hominins were still adapted to climbing trees at the time they were also walking upright. It is possible that bipedalism evolved in the trees, and was later applied to the savanna as a vestigial trait

. These changes allowed for the upright gait to be overall more energy efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. The evolutionary factors that produced these changes have been the subject of several theories that correspond with environmental changes on a global scale. Human walking is about 75% less costly than both quadrupedal and bipedal walking in chimpanzees

. Muscles near the ankle helped provide the push during walking and running. There are many advantages and disadvantages to this altered posture and gait. The ability to grab something with four appendages was lost but what was gained was the ability to hold a club or throw a spear and use the other free hand for another task. This adaptation also helped humans stand up straight with locked knees for longer periods of time

. Having long hind limbs and short forelimbs allows humans to walk upright, while orangutans and gibbons had the adaptation of longer arms to swing on branch","According to the context, one adaptation that allowed humans to walk upright more efficiently was the muscles near the ankle helping provide the push during walking and running.",0.8,0.9,0.7,0.8,0.0,"The LLM correctly points out that the placement of the vertebral column closer to the hip joint allowed for the upright gait, but it could have been more specific about the muscles involved in providing the push during walking and running."
What adaptation did the human hip undergo as a result of changes in its shape?,Energy efficient adaptation,". Change in the shape of the hip may have led to the decrease in the degree of hip extension, an energy efficient adaptation. The ilium changed from a long and narrow shape to a short and broad one and the walls of the pelvis modernized to face laterally. These combined changes provide increased area for the gluteus muscles to attach; this helps to stabilize the torso while standing on one leg

. The conversion to full-time bipedalism in our distant ancestors is the main argument for the adaptations our muscle structure and function have made. By having to center the force of gravity on two feet, the human thigh bone developed an inward slope down to the knee which may have allowed their gluteal abductors to adapt to the stress and build the necessary muscle. This allows the human to manage their balance on a single foot and when “in-stride” during walking

. In addition to the change in shoulder stability, changing locomotion would have increased the demand for shoulder mobility, which would have propelled the evolution of bipedalism forward. The different hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive and a number of selective forces may have acted together to lead to human bi","According to the context, the adaptation that the human hip underwent as a result of changes in its shape is an increased area for the gluteus muscles to attach, which helps to stabilize the torso while standing on one leg.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.9,0.0,"The LLM's answer provides a good description of the energy efficient adaptation, but it could be improved by providing more details and context."
What is the direction of the bend in the human vertebral column?,The vertebral column takes a forward bend in the lumbar (lower) region and a backward bend in the thoracic (upper) region.,". Without the lumbar curve, the vertebral column would always lean forward, a position that requires much more muscular effort for bipedal animals. With a forward bend, humans use less muscular effort to stand and walk upright. Together the lumbar and thoracic curves bring the body's center of gravity directly over the feet. Specifically, the S-shaped curve in the spine brings the center of gravity closer to the hips by bringing the torso back

. The sacrum has also become more broad, increasing the diameter of the birth canal and making birthing easier. To increase surface for ligament attachment to help support the abdominal viscera during erect posture, the ischial spines became more prominent and shifted towards the middle of the body. The vertebral column of humans takes a forward bend in the lumbar (lower) region and a backward bend in the thoracic (upper) region

. If the inward curvature of the spine is not enough, the center of balance would be offset causing the body to essentially tip forward, which is why some apes that have the ability to be bipedal require large amounts of energy to stand up. In addition to sacral angles, the sacrum has also evolved to be more flexibl","According to the context, the direction of the bend in the human vertebral column is as follows:

* The lumbar (lower) region takes a forward bend.
* The thoracic (upper) region takes a backward bend.

So, overall, the S-shaped curve in the spine brings the center of gravity closer to the hips by bringing the torso back.",0.8,0.7,0.9,0.8,0.7,"The LLM provided an incorrect answer, suggesting that the direction of the bend is from backward to forward in the lumbar and thoracic regions."
